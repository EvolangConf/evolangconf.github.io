        "summary": "Learning a language is generally considered the crown jewel of human abilities. Yet the core question of \u2018What is it about the human mammalian brain that allows us to learn our language?\u2019, remains unresolved. In humans, language acquisition is mediated by a process called \u2018vocal learning\u2019. While humans are expert vocal learners, a remarkably sparse subset of mammals share this capacity and as a result, the neurobiological mechanisms of vocal learning were never studied before in the mammalian brain. To complement the remarkable research work done in the songbird and help bridge this major gap of knowledge we set out to establish the bat as a mammalian model system for studying the neurobiological mechanism of vocal learning.",

        "summary": "Over millions of years, brain size increased and locomotion became bipedal, exacerbating parturition. Premature newborns were more likely to survive. Human infants became more helpless\u2014uniquely unable to cling or crawl. Infant survival depended increasingly on complex carer-infant communication. Of the available physical signals, fundamental frequency contour (speech prosody) transmitted the most useful information in the shortest time, both before and after birth. The human fetus became increasingly sensitive to the mother\u2019s prenatally audible voice, heartbeat, footstep and digestion patterns, which correlated with her physical and emotional state. The mother schema of the fetus/infant became more complex. Linguistic ability and complexity developed by statistical learning in mother-infant interactions, building upon prenatal learning and enabled by the increasing capacity and plasticity of cortical neural networks. A theory of origins based on mother-schema complexity is consistent with diverse aspects of behavioral modernity including language, music, religion, and consciousness.",

        "summary": "This paper investigates the perceptual dimensions that drive sound-color correspondences and linguistic evidence of color sound symbolism. In study I, we tested cross-modal correspondences between visual and acoustic dimensions through 22 experiments and found that loudness, pitch and spectral energy were implicitly associated with luminance and saturation. In study II, we investigated the acoustic parameters of speech sounds and the visual parameters of eleven color words in 245 areally spread language families. The results revealed that vowels with high brightness, sonority and F1 were overrepresented in names of colors with high luminance while color saturation was associated with the sonority of consonants. These associations could then be linked to similar associations observed in infants, apes and monkeys, and to cross-linguistic lexicalization patterns of color words. Thus, these findings create a direct link between sound-color associations and the mental lexicon which can help us understand how linguistic categories evolve and develop.",

Some non-human animal species also posses culture, which is specially broad in great apes. Whether great apes' culture is human-like (contains culture dependent traits) or is based in individually learned behavioral forms (latent solutions) is still debated. After conducting a literature review across behavioral domains and great ape species, we have compiled the most likely candidates for culture dependent traits in great apes. The staggering low number of behaviors that we found, suggest that great ape behavioral repertoires are based on latent solutions and greatly overlap among species.",

        "summary": "Pitch is often used to express pragmatic meaning (henceforth \u201ctune\u201d). This requires segmental carriers with rich harmonic structure and high periodic energy, making vowels optimal carriers of the tune. Tunes can be phonetically impoverished when there is a shortage of vowels, endangering the recovery of their function. This biases sound systems towards speech variants that optimize tune transmission by e.g. the insertion of vowels. Vocatives (used to attract and maintain the addressee\u2019s attention) are often characterized by specific tunes. Many languages also mark vocatives morphologically. One potential pathway for the emergence of vocative morphemes is the grammaticalization of tune-driven intrusive vowels that help carry pitch patterns. Looking at a corpus of 101 languages, we compared the phonological make-up of vocatives to structural case markers. Vocatives contain substantially fewer consonants, supporting our hypothesis that the acoustic properties of tunes interact with segmental features and can shape the emergence of morphological vocatives.",

        "summary": "Language discrimination has previously been found in human infants, cotton-top tamarin monkeys, rats, and java sparrows. This ability might also be relevant for the crow, a social passerine with extensive auditory perceptual skills living in close contact with humans. We tested whether crows autonomously pay attention to spoken language, and whether they can discriminate a familiar, locally spoken language (Japanese) from an unfamiliar language (Dutch) without training. The crows showed significantly more responses to the Dutch than to the Japanese, which suggests that they discriminate two languages with distinctive linguistic features, and that they might also be more attentive to an unfamiliar language, Dutch, compared to a familiar one, Japanese. These results further extend the hypothesis that language discrimination is based on a general perceptual mechanism that predates the evolution of language and show that crows can voluntarily apply this mechanism to language outside of experimental set-ups.",

Linguists have sought to define the essence of this generative capacity using formal grammars that describe the syntactic dependencies between constituents, independent of the computational limitations of the human brain. Here, we evaluate this independence assumption by sampling sentences uniformly from the space of possible syntactic structures. We find that the average dependency distance between syntactically related words, a proxy for memory limitations, is less than expected by chance in a collection of state-of-the-art classes of dependency grammars. Our findings indicate that memory limitations have permeated grammatical descriptions, suggesting that it may be theoretically impossible to capture human linguistic productivity independent of cognitive constraints.",

Languages, however, differ in the granularity of the categories they encode, and the source of these cross-linguistic differences is poorly understood. This paper uses computational simulations to show that community structure can account for such differences, reveals the mechanism by which it does so, and finds support for the proposal in an examination of real world color categorization systems. In particular, the paper shows that the obstacles for diffusion that large communities encounter push them to develop categorization systems that are both more granular and better structured, thus leading to more successful communication.",

Specifically, language change models predict that sparsely connected communities develop more regular languages, while tightly-knit communities can maintain high levels of linguistic complexity and variability. However, the effect of network structure on language evolution has not been tested experimentally. Here, we present results from a group communication study where we examined the formation of new languages created by different micro-societies, varying only in their network structure. We contrasted three different types of social networks: fully connected, small-world, and scale-free. Results show that there was no significant difference between different types of networks, and that all languages became more systematic, more accurate, more stable, and more shared over time. Nevertheless, small-world networks varied most in their behaviors, suggesting that network structure can influence susceptibility to drift.",

        "summary": "Both directed selection and stochastic drift are the driving forces of biological and cultural evolution, and this is also true for language evolution. The recent argument presented by Newberry et al. (2017) is that drift cannot be rejected and stochasticity has an under-appreciated role in grammatical changes in English. In this paper, we focus on the evolution of the English perfect construction (be/have+PP) and aim to detect signatures of selection and drift working there. We used three English Corpora\u2015EEBO, COHA, and Google Books. From these corpora, we computed the longitudinal frequency changes of have/be+PP forms in 19 target verbs. The results of our analysis show that this auxiliary selection is dependent on the nature and grammatical usage of verbs and suggest that frequency changes from be+PP to have+PP are unlikely due to random drift in these verbs.",

We investigate how transmission mode \u2013 observation (seeing someone perform an action) versus linguistic instructions (listening to how someone performed an action) \u2013 affect the probability that actions in a sequence will be copied. In addition, we compared 6 \u2013 8-year-old children with adults, and we manipulated the actions' causal relevance. We found that, (i) when it comes to causally irrelevant actions, children overimitate more in the observation condition, (ii) adults overimitate more in the linguistic instructions condition, and (ii) both children and adults imitate more causally relevant actions in the linguistic instructions condition.

Here we argue that the vocal tract anatomy and its effects on phonetics and phonology might allow us to make, when coupled with the fossil and osteological records, probabilistic inferences about long-gone linguistic diversity. For example, we may infer that pre-agricultural languages probably lacked labiodentals, and we might be able to say something about the extent of phonemic clicks in pre-Bantu-expansion Africa.",

        "summary": "Vocal learning, the capacity to add new vocalizations to one\u2019s repertoire,  is an essential prerequisite for spoken language and vocal music. However, why it evolved and why it is so peculiarly distributed across species, remain long standing questions. For instance, animals as distinct as hummingbirds and humpback whales share well-developed vocal learning capacity in common with humans, while this ability appears quite limited in nonhuman primates. In order to tackle these questions, this article brings together hypotheses about the evolutionary functions of vocal learning and the impact of the spatial environment on sexual selection processes. Consistent with these hypotheses, I suggest, based on a review of the latest evidence, that the cross-species distribution of vocal learning is associated with the spatial dimensionality of ancestral environments, and that this association is mediated by mate choice. One implication is that human vocal learning may have evolved in early (semi-)arboreal hominins.",

(2019) offer evidence that post-neolithic changes in bite configuration, owing to the adoption of agriculture, have led to the innovation and proliferation of labiodental consonants in the world\u2019s languages. We investigate the putative association between agriculture and labiodental consonants via a new approach that does not rely on phoneme inventories. We test whether labiodental sounds are actually more prevalent, in terms of usage, in languages whose speakers rely on agriculture. We rely on word lists from the Automated Similarity Judgement Program (Wichmann et al. 2018), which contains transcribed lists of common words in thousands of languages. We analyze the relative frequency of sound types in the word lists of agricultural and hunter-gatherer populations, respectively, finding differing frequencies of labiodentals across subsistence types. Using a linear mixed-effects model to control for relatedness and contact, we find modest support for an association between the frequency of labiodental consonants and the use of agriculture.",

        "summary": "Redundancy in morphological marking is found across languages (e.g., agreement, multiple exponence). Its presence is somewhat puzzling given that it adds complexity to the language, and speakers seem to disprefer production of redundant linguistic elements (for example, optional case marking is likely to be omitted when the meaning it encodes is more predictable from context).What could be the functionality of redundant morphological marking? We propose learning as a possible explanation: redundant cues may facilitate learning, making them advantageous in the system as a whole. We test this hypothesis in an artificial language learning study with children, where either word order alone or both word order and case marking serve as cues for thematic assignment. Results show that children learned the redundant language better despite having to learn and produce an additional morpheme. This supports the idea that learning constraints help maintain redundancy in language.",

Specifically, it investigates whether, given what we know about the time frame of human evolution and the estimated early human population sizes, a scenario depending on a single large mutation or on a series of small mutations is more likely. It uses extreme value theory and diffusion models to estimate the probability of mutations occurring and spreading in the population. It finds that in the end, scenarios consisting of an intermediate number of medium-sized mutations is most likely.",

        "summary": "Many mathematical models for language change have recently been proposed and their interpretation is not always straightforward. In this paper, we take a closer look at the Utterance Selection Model with preferences and reinterpret its dynamics in terms of evolutionary game theory. The analysis demonstrates that the preference associated with a variant is formally equivalent to the payoff of using that variant in the associated game. Importantly, this payoff is subjectively perceived by speakers and evolves according to the current local use of the variant. Additionally, the accommodation to others' utterances can be encoded as a mutation term in a Replicator-Mutator equation. This analysis demonstrates how arbitrary variants can acquire fitness through usage, allowing selective processes to take place.",

We tested the ability of two pinniped species (harbor and grey seals) to flexibly modify their voices in response to playbacks. Our results suggest seal pups can flexibly and spontaneously adjust their fundamental frequency and formants in response to external sounds. In other words, seal pups have good control over their vocal folds and vocal tract beyond what usually observed in most non-human mammals, and do not require explicit training to show this control. Overall, these experiments provide more evidence of how pinnipeds can be a fitting model species to better understand one side of speech evolution, namely vocal imitation, learning and plasticity.",

By searching for compositionality in the communication systems of apes, it is possible to shed light on the evolutionary progression of this trait. Using a high-density data approach, we are currently investigating the forms of vocal combinatorial structures in chimpanzees. Preliminary data indicates that call combinations represent 13% of the total production in chimpanzees and the context of production is a good predicator of the call types combined. Moreover, predator presentations revealed chimpanzees combine calls when encountering a snake, potentially to recruit group members in a dangerous situation. Ongoing playback experiments aim to further investigate the meaning and function of this call combination.\nUltimately, this work will help elucidate whether one of the building blocks of language also exists in the communication systems of our closest relative and therefore is evolutionarily more ancient.",

A concern could be if our laboratory investigations are sufficiently connected to the phenomenon they are intended to investigate. Here we attempt to bridge this epistemic gap by using archeological items directly as stimuli in an experiment. Outlines of engraved patterns dating back ~100 k years from the Blombos and Diepkloof sites in South Africa were seeded into an iterated learning lab experiment.

        "summary": "The ability to track syntactic relationships between words, particularly over a distance (\u2018non-adjacent dependencies\u2019) is a critical faculty underpinning human language. Despite its importance for language learning and processing, the origins of this ability remain poorly understood. Here, we used a novel, standardised auditory artificial grammar learning paradigm to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the capacity to process such complex structures in common marmosets, chimpanzees and humans. We show experimentally that all three of these species possess the capacity to process both adjacent and non-adjacent dependencies between arbitrary acoustic elements. These findings indicate that non-adjacent dependency processing is widespread in the primate order and predates the evolution of language by, at a minimum, 30 - 40 million years.",

        "summary": "Previous research has demonstrated that the typologically attested preference for word order harmony, consistent order of dependents relative to their head, is reflected in individual learning behaviour in artificial language learning. To address the hypothesis that the word order harmony bias is driven by a bias for simplicity, we compared the its strength in one- and two-modifier contexts. It was predicted that the harmony bias would be stronger in the one-modifier conditions given that the harmonic grammar is simpler than non-harmonic grammar, whereas in two-modifier phrases the grammars are equally simple. While a harmony bias based on overproduction of the harmonic majority orders was not observed, entropy measures showed a difference in regularisation of harmonic and non-harmonic orders in the one-modifier conditions but not in the two-modifier conditions. The results presented here provide tentative evidence to support the hypothesis that a bias for word order harmony is rooted in simplicity.",

        "summary": "Investigations of enactment (non-conventional, improvised, bodily depictions) are integral for understanding the origins and evolution of language. Signers and speakers use enactment to mimetically depict the actions, utterances, thoughts and feelings of themselves and others. One question is how signers use visible bodily enactment to depict a referent while indexing other \u2018invisible\u2019 referents in the space around them \u2013 thus both \u2018showing\u2019 one referent with their body while simultaneously \u2018seeing\u2019 another. Here we describe how deaf signers of British Sign Language (BSL) do this during conversations. Across ~1,300 multimodal clause utterances from ten signers, almost one-fifth included enactment (n=246). Signers mainly used enactment to depict their own actions, but also those of other people and non-human referents. A subset also included invisible referents (n=50) indexing other people, organisations and objects. These results highlight the coordinated complexity of depiction and indexicality within enactments occurring in everyday interactions between deaf signers of an established signed language.",

        "summary": "Understanding the variables that shape the use and evolution of vocal communication in non-human primates can inform understanding of how language evolved. Social complexity might drive communicative complexity and one important, but neglected measure of social complexity is dominance style (the strictness with which the dominance hierarchy is enforced: tolerant to despotic). As the outcomes of social interactions in more tolerant societies are more uncertain (Dobson, 2012), we predicted that more tolerant individuals and species would have a greater need for more frequent and more diverse vocal signals to negotiate their social interactions. Using Bayesian analyses on observational data from wild groups of 25 species, we show that more tolerant individuals vocalise at a higher rate, but more despotic species have a wider range of hierarchy-related vocalisations in their repertoires. Our findings indicate that dominance style is a valuable social variable for understanding vocal usage and evolution in primates.",

We manipulated the degree to which production pressures to reliably locate a point in the articulatory space aligned with perceptual pressures to user more easily distinguishable colors. Systems where the two pressures were misaligned exhibited lower dispersion and symmetry not only in the production space (suggesting that perception was guiding production) but also in the perceptual space (suggesting a compromise between perception and production). Above-chance levels of dispersion and symmetry occurred only in the condition with good alignment. In general dispersion and symmetry was correlated with success in the game.",

In speech, sequences are fundamentally important in the perception of phonological and syntactic patterns. In birdsong, the production of sequences has been well-described, but the importance of these sequences in perception is uncertain or equivocal for most species. Here, we summarize the results of several studies which show limitations in avian perception of sequences and a greater importance of the acoustic details of individual elements. These results suggest that birdsong may be architecturally different than human language \u2013 with information primarily conveyed in the acoustic details of vocal elements and the sequential patterns of those elements having at best secondary importance. We also highlight greater sequence sensitivity in the budgerigar, a psittacine, compared to the zebra finch, a songbird, illustrating how a careful species comparison might be useful for studying human language evolution.",

In contrast, if natural language semantics reflect cultural, historic, and geographic factors, word meanings may differ substantially between languages. We computed semantic alignments for 1016 meanings in 74 languages. The results show that the most aligned words are not those naming ``natural'' joints -- natural kinds, common actions and artifacts -- but rather comprise internally structured domains (number, quantity, kinship). We find that alignment can be predicted from cultural, historic, and geographic distances between languages. Alignment is also positively associated with population size. Controlling for shared history, languages spoken by larger groups tend to align better. Our results provide strong evidence that semantics do not simply mirror the structure of the world, but impose their own structure, reflecting cultural and historical processes.",

We show this by simulating language emergence in communities of Bayesian learners who remember each other. \n\nOur analysis is motivated by research on emerging sign languages, which suggests that social structure affects the process of language convergence. Specifically, sign languages that emerge in small, highly-connected communities are less conventionalized, showing greater lexical variability between speakers. On the other hand, languages that emerge in larger and sparser communities tend to be more uniform. This finding directly contrasts with previous theoretical results suggesting that shared conventions emerge faster in smaller populations. We argue that the evidence from emerging sign language can be explained by an interaction between population size and our capacity to remember individual speakers/signers, which inverts the relationship between population size and convergence rates.",

Here, we directly investigate this hypothesis by focusing on a fundamental feature of languages: word order. \nWe provide the first direct comparison of word order variability (a proxy for the degree of conventionalization) in two emerging sign languages: (1) Central Taurus Sign Language, a village sign language used in a small community Turkey, and (2) Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language, a bigger village sign language used in Israel. \nOur results show that CTSL signers show less convergence as a community (i.e., producing significantly more word order variants across different signers, p=0.016), and are less consistent in their own productions (i.e., producing significantly more word order variants as individuals, p=0.013).",

        "summary": "One proposal about how humans are able to acquire language without a specialized neural mechanism is that, through cultural evolution, languages have incorporated various cues to facilitate learning and use. Phonological typicality, the phenomenon whereby words from similar semantic classes sound similar, is one of those cues. In this study, we found that there is evidence both for the presence and the usefulness of such phonological cues in separating words for actions and objects in nearly 200 languages from a wide variety of families and geographical zones. These results indicate that many languages from across the world use phonological typicality to signal broad meaning distinctions, consistent with the hypothesis that that language has evolved to depend on multiple-cue integration for its acquisition and processing.",

        "summary": "Hypotheses about the co-evolution of language and toolmaking consider both the cognitive demands of production and the communicative demands of social transmission. Regarding the latter, it has been suggested that increasingly complex toolmaking technologies required and selected for more complex communication technologies.  I argue that the unique function of language - the instruction of imagination - is not necessary for the social transmission of skill, and that mimetic communication, its likely precursor, is sufficient. To demonstrate this I review evidence from both ethnographic and experimental studies. Hunter-gatherer ethnographies suggest that social learning relies mainly on observation, experimentation, participation, and play. Experiments comparing gestural and verbal teaching of tool-making skills also demonstrate that gestural communication is sufficient, and that language does not improve transmission. I conclude that mimesis would have been sufficient for the social transmission of toolmaking skills, and that this is very likely true for other skills like hunting and foraging.",

However, the complex network of interactions between value systems, population biases and institutional reinforcement has received comparatively little attention, in particular, when applied to micro-scale modelling of experimental designs of language evolution. How does the introduction of institutions that are sensitive to individuals' choices affect the maintenance of the diversity of the communicative system under enforced global connectivity? We use agent-based models to simulate micro-societies and we draw on well established metrics to quantify cultural diversity. Our model can help to better understand the relationship between value systems and endangered languages in the context of a globalized society, which might be useful for policy makers and institutional regulators.",

Although politeness is part and parcel of the fabric of human interaction, and as such of great interest to social psychology, human ethology and human behavioral ecology, research into the social costs and benefits of speaking politely is in its infancy. From a utility-based and cost-benefit perspective, many forms of polite language can be seen as instances of \"strategic use of conversational politeness\" (SCP). Existing utility-based accounts of SCP assume the costs of polite communications to be cashed out in somewhat nebulous social commodity: 'face'. In contrast, the recently proposed Responsibility Exchange Theory (RET) by Chaudhry & Loewenstein (2019) explains SCP in situations involving a transfer of credit or blame by grounding costs and benefits in more tangible social constructs: (perceived) competence and (perceived) warmth. In this research, we extend their epistemic model into a broader, evolutionary model of SCP.",

        "summary": "Can cross-linguistic variation in spatial language be explained by environmental factors? Statistical links are mostly correlational, and causality rarely attested. One way to avoid spurious correlations is to integrate such findings with laboratory experiments that can be used to uncover cognitive biases or general mechanisms shaping linguistic structure. In recent years, several studies have shown that languages can adapt to referential contexts or the situations in which they evolve. However, such experiments usually deal with highly abstract and artificial laboratory settings. Here we present a new, more naturalistic approach using Virtual Reality (VR) that allows studying the adaptivity of spatial language with increased ecological validity while maintaining tight experimental control. We show first experimental evidence that spatial language used in large-scale VR environments for joint problem-solving can adapt to environmental properties. More generally, we show that VR is a powerful new tool to study linguistic adaptation in the laboratory.",

In this work, we build further on earlier work within the language game paradigm and investigate how human-interpretable concepts can be distilled from a number of continuous-valued feature channels. For this, we set up a series of tutor-learner experiments in a world consisting of geometrical objects with different colours, sizes, materials and shapes. For each concept, the learner must simultaneously learn which feature channels are important to which extent, and what the prototypical value for each channel is. We explore different concept learning strategies and evaluate not only how well the concepts can be learned but also their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions.",

The results of multiple experiments showed that rhythmic cognition is based on general auditory and cognitive mechanisms and are not modulated by linguistic experience and are shared by all mammals. As the ability to discriminate rhythmic patterns of utterances is a prerequisite for successful language acquisition, the suggested mechanisms of rhythmic cognition function as the precursors of speech emergence in the phylogenetic development of homo genera.",

The neural implementation of Merge is not well understood, but must involve something functionally equivalent to pointers in working memory. Every Merge requires two pointers, and full syntactic trees may require dozens. Other syntactic paradigms also need pointers.\nHumans do hierarchies in general better than chimpanzees. Any hierarchical thinking requires nested pointers in working memory, but they are neurologically expensive and degrade with depth. Humans have larger working-memory capacity than chimpanzees, which has been proposed as key to human cognitive evolution. Gradual evolutionary growth of pointer capacity will allow gradually increasing syntactic complexity, without saltations in the underlying computational machinery. Both depth degradation and pointer capacity naturally limit Merge even in modern humans, consistent with corpus data.",

        "summary": "The ability to generate hierarchical structures is a core component of the human faculty of language. Thus, understanding how hierarchy is biologically instantiated in linguistic syntax and in other domains is crucial to understand how language evolved. In this experiment we will investigate which neural structures are important to acquire recursive hierarchical rules in the visual domain vis a vis the capacity to parse hierarchical depth in linguistic syntax. In particular, we will investigate which brain lesions (in a group of 44 patients) specifically impair the capacity to acquire those rules. Our findings reveal specific neural and behavioural commonalities between vision and language in the capacity to process hierarchical depth, supporting the hypothesis that similar mechanisms are involved in the capacity to build hierarchical representations in both domains. This suggests that recursive hierarchical embedding did not evolve independently in the domains of vision and language.",

        "summary": "Language use relies on the pragmatic ability to take into account an interlocutor\u2019s perspective when producing and interpreting utterances. Previous computational models of iterated language learning have explored (i) the co-evolution of language and culturally-transmitted pragmatic ability, and (ii) the co-evolution of language and biologically evolved pragmatic ability when language-learning co-develops with the ability to infer others\u2019 perspectives. Both approaches depended on selection pressures for the division of labour we see in natural language---pragmatic communication combined with underspecified lexicons---to become dominant in a population. Our model combines the features of these previous approaches to show that language, pragmatic communication, and perspective-inference can all simultaneously culturally evolve. Without any selection pressures, our model resulted in more pragmatic speakers than literal speakers, and more underspecified languages than unambiguous languages. We argue that this is because pragmatic communication can act as an \u201cattractor\u201d in the space of culturally evolving systems.",

Recently, with the development of deep learning techniques, research in grounded language learning has also started to focus on facilitating the emergence of compositional languages without pre-defined elementary linguistic knowledge.\n\nIn this work, we explore the emergence of compositional languages for numeric concepts in multi-agent communication systems. We demonstrate that compositional language for encoding numeric concepts can emerge through iterated learning in populations of deep neural network agents. However, language properties greatly depend on the input representations given to agents. We found that compositional languages only emerge if they require less iterations to be fully learnt than other non-degenerate languages for agents on a given input representation.",

We investigate the principles in the evolution of the moral lexicon by asking whether the chronological emergence of moral words follows predictable patterns beyond randomness. We explore this hypothesis with a family of models inspired by recent work on historical semantic chaining and test these models against ~9,000 moral words appearing in English over the past millennium. We consider emergence as the first usage in which moral meaning is assigned to a word form. We find that models based on semantic and orthographic neighbourhood density recapitulate the chronological emergence of moral words better than chance and the alternative models, suggesting an incremental process of chaining in lexical evolution that mirrors observations from meaning emergence of individual words. Our work offers a formal account for the mechanisms in the evolution of the lexicon.",

We will discuss the relevance of human-centered approaches in the understanding of the evolution of human language and non-human communication systems, and we will propose an alternative that consists in studying inherited domain-general properties that we share with other species. The idea we uphold here is that complex and phylogenetically recent cognitive functions like language are probably the result of intense re-use and re-combination of subsets of non-linguistic anatomical, cognitive and behavioral components that are not uniquely found in humans.",

        "summary": "The hierarchical nature is one of the most striking characteristics of the human language syntax and hence the mechanism and the underlying rule(s) behind it should be treated as an evolutionary explanandum. However, this important evolutionary question has been swept under the rug by most of the syntacticians since they incessantly rely on so-called \"Merge,\" an elementary combinatoric operation defined in such a way to describe (crucially, not to explain) the hierarchy of syntax. Reflecting this state of affairs, I propose an alternative modeling of the human language syntax by decomposing the hypothetical syntactic computation into its pieces and provide an experimentally feasible theory that makes it possible to investigate the nature and mechanisms of hierarchical structure building in a comparative fashion with other species.",

Here, we ask whether conceptual alignment is increased by the use of language. We test the link in a novel way: by taking advantage of natural variability in people\u2019s self-reported internal verbalization. While most people describe frequently experiencing inner speech, others do so to a much lesser degree, or not at all. We used a questionnaire to quantify differences in people\u2019s internal verbalization, and tested the association in two studies. Study 1 found that people with higher internal verbalization rated typicality of items (e.g., types of cars, dogs etc.) in more similar ways to one another. Study 2 showed that people with higher internal verbalization produced drawings that were more typical exemplars of a cued category. The results support the idea that greater use of language promotes conceptual alignment.",

We present evidence that glutamatergic signaling genes --- which show above-chance signals of positive selection in ours and domesticated species --- are crucial regulators of the HPA axis and striatal circuits essential for vocal learning. We explore the possibility that convergent selective pressures of (self-)domestication, attenuating the stress response in our species and domesticated songbirds, had the concomitant result of potentiating striatal-dependent vocal-learning abilities.",

Despite growing evidence that the communication of nonhuman primates, our main models for language evolution, is also inherently multimodal, the function of multimodality in these taxa remains poorly understood. Here, we examined dyadic interactions of Bornean (Pongo pygmaeus) and Sumatran orang-utans (P. abelii) living in both wild and captive settings, to explicitly test whether socio-ecology (particularly, visibility and availability of social partners) influenced the use of multimodal (i.e. involving multiple sensory modalities) as well as multiplex (i.e. involving multiple articulators) communication. First analyses revealed that purely visual (non-contact) communicative acts were significantly less, but tactile and multimodal acts more common in P. pygmaeus in the least sociable wild population (Tuanan)  compared to the other species-setting combinations. Moreover, both multimodal and multiplex communication was more pervasive in wild than captive settings. These preliminary findings indicate that multi-component communication in orang-utans facilitates detection and disambiguation of a specific message, supporting a redundancy function.",

Here we use phylogenetic comparative methods to examine the ancestral states and trajectory of kinship evolution in Sino-Tibetan populations. We constructed a phylogenetic tree of 132 Sino-Tibetan languages using cognate data to represent the ancestral relationship among ethnolinguistic groups. We then coded the descent and post-marital residence norms of each group using a variety of ethnographic and historical sources. We inferred the ancestral states of residence, descent and rates of transitions between states using Bayesian RJMCMC methods as implemented in BayesTraits. Our findings show that, contrary to popular beliefs in China, matrilineal descent and matrilocal/duolocal residence are likely recent adaptations among Sino-Tibetan groups. We found strong evidence that proto-Sino-Tibetan circa. 7000 BP practised patrilineal descent and patrilocal residence. Furthermore, no unidirectional model of kinship evolution received support in our analysis, transitions from patrilineal/patrilocal to matrilineal/matrilocal systems occurred at a similar rate to transitions in the other direction. With the exception of Bodo-Koch clade, there is no statistically-significant evidence of matrilineal ancestry.",

        "summary": "Recursion, or structural self-embedding, is perhaps a unique cognitive capacity which underlies syntactic structures in language but is also available in vision among other faculties. Aiming to clarify whether it is primarily linguistic and coopted to other domains, here we show that visual recursion does not depend on linguistic recursion in ontogeny. We ran a test which contrasts a serial visual iteration task (EIT) with a fractal, recursive visual task (VRT) on AX, a 12y.o. autistic child, who completely lacks linguistic recursion (in comprehension and production) despite possessing an oral open-ended nominal lexicon. AX\u2019s accuracy in VRT was similar to 9-10 y.o. age group (77%) and superior to his performance on EIT, which is instead easier in controls. Whether these results speak in favor of recursion being multiple-domain-specific or domain-general is further discussed.",

The detection of vowel spaces homologous with human\u2019s in multiple non-human primates pushes the Dawn of Speech back at least to our last common ancestor with Cercopithecoidea, some 27 million years ago.  This is about 100x earlier than envisioned under LDT and under the discontinuity scenarios of some linguists, who saw speech emergence and language emergence as recent, sudden, and simultaneous, a consequence of the speciation event about 300,000 years ago leading to anatomically modern Homo sapiens.  This scenario is now untenable, since speech emergence was early and slow relative to language emergence.  Whenever language emerged, it had to integrate with some stage of a previously developed speech system.",

As a prerequisite for this hypothesis, we tested how \u2018beautiful\u2019 and \u2018likeable\u2019 people perceived certain linguistic stimuli. More specifically, we focused on the aesthetic perception of different temporal rhythmic patterns of words. We found that people evaluated words with isochronous syllables and words with finally lengthened syllables as equally aesthetic, but perceived words with finally shortened syllables as less aesthetic. This might help to explain actual historical sound changes, for example why in the Middle English period, words that ended in the phonetically reduced and short vowel schwa lost this vowel completely.",

        "summary": "This paper discusses indexical signaling as a possible precursor of declarative sentences in the evolution of language. Such a proposal is based on two assumptions. The first is known as the social intelligence hypothesis. The second is the function-first approach to explaining the evolution of traits: before a prototype of a new trait develops and the adaptation process begins, something already existing is used for a new purpose. Applied to the emergence of declarative sentences, this suggests that for language evolution to begin, something already existing was used for a declarative function (expressing a proposition). Thus, the evolutionary hypothesis presented here is that before human language began to develop, natural signs (such as indexical objects) were integrated into communication. I show that such a behavioral display can imply a conceptual structure similar to that informing the syntax of sentences.",

To do so, we constructed a large-scale online smartphone application that presented participants all over the world with a referential communication task. In the game, participants were asked to describe colors using only black-and-white symbols. In an additional online study, speakers of English, German, and French were tasked with naming our set of 32 colors in their native language. We then use these data as a baseline for the analyses on the same languages in the experimental semiotics task (reflecting communication instead of naming) by factor analysis. Our findings show that the structure evolving in artificial language games can reflect the one found in natural language, at least to some degree, and that this common structure affects both performance and usage of this artificial language.",

        "summary": "A key communicative resource available to sign language users is the use of space to distinguish between referents and to express relationships between them. While spatial tracking of referents is found in co-speech gesture, evidence from young sign languages suggests that systematic use of spatial devices emerges gradually. We present an investigation of the cultural transmission of spatial devices using a novel experimental method, drawing on artificial sign language experiments and the cultural evolution of stories. Participants first watched a video of a story depicted in pantomime, and were asked to record their own video, which was then shown to the next person in one of the 9 chains of 6 generations each. We find that participants identified characters using a mixture of lexical labels and spatial strategies, typically shifting their body orientation when embodying different characters. Over generations, the use of body shifting increased across chains.",

This is proposed to explain why linear orders that transparently map to this hierarchy (termed homomorphic orders) are overwhelmingly common in the typology. Following previous experimental work, we test learners\u2019 sensitivity to this hypothesised hierarchy using an artificial language learning task. In the task, participants are required to infer relative word order in the noun phrase. We will compare results from an English-speaking population (whose language is homomorphic) to those from a K\u00ee\u00eetharaka-speaking population (whose language is non-homomorphic). If the hypothesised hierarchy is universal and drives noun phrase structure cross-linguistically, we should expect both populations to prefer homomorphic orders in the artificial language.",

Studies of register, genre and stylistic variation, however, have demonstrated that language varies systematically depending on the communicative contexts in which it is used. In this paper we develop a generalized evolutionary model of language change focusing at the level of textual genre. The empirical focus of the study is on the written genre of the patent specification. Using an innovative combination of rhetorical move analysis and string edit distance techniques, we trace the evolution of the patent specification from the eighteenth century to the present day, and provide an evolutionary account of how texts in this genre changed over time. We find that this genre has evolved in a \u2018punctuated gradualist\u2019 manner over the last 300 years.",

Pied babblers produce alert-recruitment call combinations when encountering predators, eliciting mobbing behaviour with prolonged alertness and instantaneous recruitment of conspecifics. Through behavioural observations and predator presentation experiments we show that the combination is structurally highly conserved in its call order. Despite this stereotypy, modifications to the call combination can nonetheless be comprehended by receivers. Specifically, playback experiments exposing babblers to an unnatural, reversed call order of their alert-recruitment combination revealed that adult birds, but not fledglings, responded in identical ways to natural and reversed-ordered variants. This suggests, firstly, the call combination represents a compositionally \u201copen\u201d structure that can tolerate modifications, likely through babblers\u2019 ability to relate the meaning of the whole to its comprising individually meaningful calls, and secondly, an ontogenetic component in the acquisition of a \u201ccompositional awareness\u201d.",

        "summary": "Besides arbitrary relationships between meaning and form, language is also characterised by iconicity and predictable, systematic patterns (Dingemanse et al. 2015, TiCS). Iconicity is usually associated with learning and bootstrapping of communication systems, e.g., when a novel communication system must be grounded, while systematicity allows for productivity and category learning. However, it appears that there is not just one way of motivating signals based on meaning: By re-analysing data from a silent gesture experiment (N\u00f6lle et al. 2018, Cognition), we show how signs can be grounded based on different indexical, metonymic and idiosyncratic relations to their assigned referents. We show that these particularly matter in experimental semiotics settings where discrimination of targets among competitors is usually a central task element and simple pointing impaired. Our results show that besides representing the referents, participants rely on metonymic associations as well as finding minimally discriminative traits, especially under working memory pressure.",

        "summary": "Word meanings change over time, usually following routes predicted by general cognitive principles. While significant advances in understanding lexical meaning change have been made, relatively few studies have focused on large-scale quantitative testing of the proposed meaning change laws. It has, for instance, been hypothesized that older words are on average more polysemous, since they have had more time to develop new meanings through meaning shifts. I perform a large-scale quantitative test of this hypothesis, extracting data for 16K English verbs, 45K adjectives and 102K nouns from the Oxford English Dictionary. I show that the hypothesis holds, but the correlation between age and polysemy depends on the word frequency, being stronger for the more frequent words.",

        "summary": "Evolution and learning are both processes that allow organisms to extract and store information about their environment. But when and how do the exploratory dynamics of these processes differ? We present the results of an iterated category learning experiment, where the number and placement of participants' category boundaries are free to evolve over time. We contrast two evolutionary regimes: one where category systems are transmitted over multiple learners and one where they are developed within a single learner, for the same amount of time.  We find that there are more constraints on the exploratory process when systems are culturally transmitted among multiple learners. Single learners explore a wider range of category systems and converge on more complex systems, whereas transmission chains explore a more restricted set of systems and nearly always converge on a simple, but easily learnable, one-boundary category system.",

However, evaluating the exact role of loners in such models is not easy nor direct, and their network structure was based on a simulated artificial network. To address these issues, we first replicated Fagyal et al. (2010)\u2019s model using the same parameters, and visualized the process of language diffusion spatially across multiple simulations. We then tested the DBVM model on a large-scale, real-world \u201cwho-trust-whom\u201d online social network. Finally, we scaled down the online social network and manipulated the numbers of edges (i.e., the number of possible connections). This result has important implications for the process of cultural transmission, and suggests that language change is more difficult in a dense network.",

Newly emerging communication systems provide a window into the cognitive and interactional basis of these skills. In a novel paradigm, children were required to convey meaning to a partner while being unable to use spoken language. The gestural code systems children created ad hoc within a 30 minute test session exhibited core-features of natural language and emergent sign languages: referential signals for objects, actions and abstract concepts, conventional use of these signals, and grammatical structure. These results demonstrate that language-like communication systems can emerge rapidly out of social interaction.",

        "summary": "This paper proposes a systemic approach to phoneme inventory size. Analyzing parallel textual material of 56 languages (17 language families), it was found that phoneme inventory size significantly correlates with syllable size in number of phonemes and word length in number of syllables. The strong correlation between inventory size and syllable complexity suggests that the systematic interactions found in previous studies between syllable complexity and the language system also applies to phoneme inventory size. E.g.: Languages with complex syllables and a large phoneme inventory tend to morphological simplicity (fewer cases, isolating morphology, etc.). Lupyan and Dale (2010) report an inverse relationship between morphological simplicity (fewer cases, isolating etc.) and population size. If morphological simplicity correlates with both large population size and large phoneme inventory size, then this might explain Hay and Bauer\u2019s (2007) finding that inventory size and population size are positively correlated.",

Animal models provide an excellent opportunity to study the genetic underpinnings of vocal learning, a core trait necessary in order to obtain spoken language. In this study, we have designed an shRNA construct to knock down FoxP2 in the striatum of vocal learning bats. The striatum has been proven to be affected by mutations of FOXP2 in humans. Studying the consequences of introducing this FoxP2 knockdown into the brains of living bats will allow us to determine the consequences of FoxP2 loss at a molecular, neurobiological and behavioural level. This will help to bridge the gaps in our knowledge across taxa, giving us a more complete picture on the evolution of vocal learning and human speech.",

        "summary": "Geographical variations in song features of birds are well known and result from social learning and concern both social and territorial species. Song playplack experiments show that birds tend to react more but with less aggressiveness to their own dialect. However, dialectal communities of territorial neighbours show the same features. One other hypothesis would be that such \u201cdialect communities\u201d are in fact \u201cpseudo-social\u201d communities. We propose that there could be a gradient between sociality and territoriality in songbird species. We compared two congeneric species of African sturnids, the territorial red-winged starling Onychognathus morio and the colonial pale-winged starling Onychognathus nabouroup. In both species, we broadcasted songs either from their own population or another distant one. Results show that the birds of both species clearly discriminated their own local variant from that of another population but also showed more attention towards their own dialect and more intolerance, towards a foreign variant",

        "summary": "It has been shown that social structure affects language variation. One natural example of this can be observed in sign language emergence. In order to investigate this, we use a picture description task with 46 deaf and hearing signers from the shared sign language Kata Kolok. In order to investigate lexical variation, we use the following three steps: 1) we focus on the first variant in the sequence produced by participants, 2) we classify signs on the basis of underlying iconic motivation and mapping, and 3) we compare individual repertoires by calculating the lexical distance between participants. We find that a) there is a large amount of lexical variation in Kata Kolok, and b) this variation is conditioned by whether individuals are deaf or hearing. We do not find that any other sociolinguistic factors predict variation in Kata Kolok, likely due to the tight-knit social structure of this community.",

        "summary": "Theory of Mind (ToM) \u2014 the ability to represent or reason about others' mental states (Apperly, 2012) \u2014 carries a significant burden in explaining how humans communicate (Woensdregt & Smith, 2017; Tomasello, Carpenter, Call, Behne, & Moll, 2005; Dunbar, 2004), especially when it comes to inferring someone's communicative intentions in the absence of a conventional language. If we accept that language use requires sophisticated pragmatics (Scott-Phillips, 2014), then ToM must be either a necessary condition for language evolution or something that co-evolved with language (Woensdregt & Smith, 2017; Heyes, 2018; Sterelny, 2012; Levinson, 2006). In either case, it is an important component of the study of language evolution.\n\nHowever, there is increasing recognition that 'Theory of Mind' does not refer to a single cognitive mechanism, and that ToM research employs a variety of methods that tap numerous distinct cognitive mechanisms (Apperly, 2012; Schaafsma, Pfaff, Spunt, & Adolphs, 2015). Recent empirical work demonstrates low levels of agreement between various individual-differences scales that are meant to tap ToM ability (Warnell & Redcay, 2019; Gernsbacher & Yergeau, 2019). Thus, the role of ToM in human communication \u2014 and by implication, in language evolution \u2014 is radically underspecified (Irvine, 2018).\n\nWe report two studies that aim to improve this state of affairs. Study 1 examined relationships between various measures of ToM ability. Study 2 examined whether ToM measures and several other non-ToM-related problem solving abilities predicted performance on a linguistic signaling task.\n\nIn Study 1, we administered a battery of ToM individual-differences measures to 50 adults. We included a False Belief measure (Valle, Massaro, Castelli, & Marchetti, 2015) \u2014 the gold-standard test of ToM ability (Apperly, 2012); a co-ordination task (Mehta, Starmer, & Sugden, 1994); a Keynesian beauty contest (Keynes, 1938); the 'Understanding Others' subscale of the Autistic Spectrum Quotient (Stewart & Austin, 2009; Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, & Clubley, 2001); and a task based on the Rational Speech Act (RSA) frame-work, in which people produce and interpret visual cues to disambiguate between a set of referents (Goodman & Frank, 2016). We found low, non-significant correlations between most of the measures, even though they all ostensibly involve reasoning about others' minds. This was also true of the False Belief task, despite its purported centrality to ToM. One exception was a Schelling coordination task (Mehta et al., 1994), success on which required participants to leverage salient features of shared knowledge. This task had moderate correlations with several ToM measures (even though the ToM measures did not correlate with each other), though notably not with the False Belief task.\n\nIn study 2 (n=106), we examined whether various ToM measures predicted performance on a linguistic signaling task which required taking the perspective of the one's interlocutor (Sulik & Lupyan, 2018). Because a pilot study showed that certain problem-solving skills (creative: Bowden & Jung-Beeman, 2007; analytic: Frederick, 2005) positively correlated with performance on this signaling task, we included assessments of these two reasoning measures in this study. This also allowed us to examine whether analytic and creative problem-solving explained any of the covariance between ToM measures. Although there were significant zero-order correlations between performance on the perspective-taking task and the ToM measures, the first-order partial correlations (controlling for the effect of analytic problem solving) were not significant, except for the first-order correlation between RSA task and Schelling task. For the remaining tasks, the apparent relationship is largely driven by analytic problem solving ability. In addition, creative problem solving predicted unique variance in the perspective-taking task, but not the other ToM tasks. Thus, most common tasks in this field lack an element crucial for the linguistic perspective-taking task \u2014 creativity \u2014 and this represents an important gap in the current literature on the evolution of pragmatics.\n\nThe ability to take the perspective of others \u2014 frequently encompassed under the umbrella term 'Theory of Mind' \u2014 is claimed to be central to the human ability to learn and use language (Levinson, 2006). Here, we found that measures purporting to assess ToM did not correlate with one another (Study 1) \u2014 a surprising finding if ToM tasks tap into a single general ToM trait. One exception was that the ability to discover salient coordination points (as assessed by the Schelling task), was correlated with several ToM measures, hinting that something like \u201csalience reasoning\u201d may be a better description of the relevant cognitive mechanism. Further, performance on ToM tasks \u2014 while varying between individuals \u2014 did not predict performance on a linguistic perspective-taking task (Study 2). Instead, better perspective taking was predicted by better performance on non-ToM tasks such as creative and analytic reasoning. Taken together, our results challenge the explanatory power accorded to ToM in human communication. We argue that to explain the evolution of human pragmatic inference, we need a better understanding of relevant cognitive mechanisms. We have identified several candidates, including creative reasoning and analytic reasoning.",

        "summary": "A match-to-sample, forced-choice paradigm was used in four experiments to test whether nonsigners are sensitive to the patterns of noun-verb derivation observed in many sign languages. Nouns are often derived from verbs by (1) movement reduplication and size reduction or (2) size reduction alone (if the verb has reduplicated movement). Nonsigners were asked to pair drawings of actions and objects with videos of noun and verb pairs in American Sign Language. Contrary to our predictions, nonsigners either were not sensitive to these rules (performing at chance) or they exhibited a bias that was the opposite of sign languages, preferring to match small reduplicated movements with actions, rather than objects. Whether or not the noun-verb pairs exhibited pantomimic iconicity did not affect the results. We speculate that internal linguistic pressures (a large lexicon, directional verbs) might override this weak, initial bias to map \u201cmore movement\u201d (reduplication) to depict actions.",

In motor coordination, the cerebellum is believed to aid sensory feedback prediction through the generation of internal forward models which are able to simulate sensorimotor processes and anticipate sensory feedback. Whether the cerebellum performs a similar function during non-motor behaviours is a matter of ongoing debate. This work explores the role of the cerebellum and disrupted sensory feedback prediction in auditory hallucinations in order to gain a better understanding of the role of the cerebellum in active perception, and how this bears on our understanding of language function in the brain as well as the role of cerebellar volume expansion during primate evolution.",

        "summary": "It is an open question if non-human primates share rhythmic abilities with humans. Indri lemurs produce loud howling cries, in the form of duets and choruses. We tested whether overlapping and turn-taking during the songs followed a recognizable pattern, by analyzing the structure, timing and organization of the individual contributions to the song. We observed that males and females, both dominants and non-dominants influenced the onset timing of their calls, showing nonrandom overlap between singers\u2019 units. Indri songs are sexually dimorphic, both in the overall timing and repertoire size and in the unit and phrase structure, with females being more flexible than males in their contributions. The structure of phrases possess also individually distinctive characteristics. Our study suggests that the indris are a good model for further investigations of the evolution of human speech features.",

Some non-human animals also have vocal learning capabilities. Grey seals are vocal learners, and by studying the neurobiology of vocal learning in grey seals, we can better understand the neurobiological basis and evolutionary trajectory of vocal learning and human spoken language. As grey seal brains have not yet been investigated, the objective of the study was to conduct a first neuroanatomical investigation of the grey seal brain. Using MRI, dissection, and immunohistochemistry, we have created a first atlas, template, and 3D model of the grey seal brain. Grey seal brains are relatively large compared to terrestrial carnivores, with a highly convoluted cortex, a large cerebellum and temporal lobe, and a small olfactory area. Future work can build upon this research and dive into the comparative neurobiology of vocal learning in grey seals.",

        "summary": "Two iterated language learning experiments manipulated amount of learning, temporal features and modality in signals comprising binary sequences, to explore conditions under which non-arbitrary signal-meaning links emerge. Assembled into a total of 24 chains with 10 generations each, participants alternated comprehension and production tasks to create the dual pressures of ambiguity avoidance and effort minimization. Results showed that for such unfamiliar signals iconicity emerged while compositionality did not. For auditory signals (Experiment 1), emergence of iconicity required a 'sweet spot' such that there needed to be enough learning to retain crucial signal features yet not too much so as not to prevent productive modifications. However, no iconicity emerged for visual signals that mimicked signal fading over time found in the auditory domain (Experiment 2). Results underscore the ubiquity of iconicity and the importance of taking into account learning-based, modality-specific and temporal properties of signals in iterated language learning experiments.",

        "summary": "There has been a growing interest in the role emerging sign languages can play in our understanding of language evolution. In particular, work on home sign systems (e.g., Goldin-Meadow & Brentari, 2017), Nicaraguan Sign Language (e.g., Kocab et al., 2015) and Al Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language (e.g., Sandler, 2017) has provided a range of evidence about how grammar develops in new sign languages. Often this data is compared to current understanding of established sign languages, such as American Sign Language. However, existing assumptions about established sign languages such as British Sign Language and Australian Sign Language are beginning to be challenged by corpus data (e.g., Johnston et al., 2015; Fenlon et al., 2018). In this paper, we discuss our concern that claims about language emergence need to be solidly grounded in a detailed understanding of the structure and use of both emerging and established sign languages.",

        "summary": "We extend recent efforts in gamified experimental studies of language evolution with a new multi-player game. The game revolves around communication with unfamiliar graphical symbols, and follows the style popular browser-based .io games for engaging, voluntary play from the perspective of the participants. Players use a pre-specified set of symbols to communicate about colour, but the explicit goal of the game is not communication. Instead, players are focused on an internal goal, which the game mechanics only make implicitly possible via communication with other players. We present qualitative results from early pilots with small groups, providing a detailed description of the game concept and mechanics. We argue that this framework is well-suited not only to studying consensus in language-like systems, but divergence, cooperation and competition, naturalistic social network structure, and issues surrounding form and meaning space constraints. In short, we demonstrate specific potential for studying the emergence of language-like conventions, but also provide an open-ended `petri dish' for experiments in cultural evolution and collective behaviour generally.",

        "summary": "We examine how sound symbolism could have helped people create the first spoken words. Sound symbolism can help people connect spoken forms and meanings in the absence of convention. Yet, experiments in the dominant kiki-bouba paradigm typically do not focus on creative aspects of meaning-making, but instead on comprehension as discrete mappings between forms and referents. We illustrate this contrast with a drawn replication of K\u00f6hler\u2019s (1947) classic experiment. Participants drew kikis, boubas, taketes, and malumas in two contexts: as creatures or company symbols. We find that kikis and taketes are both spikier and smaller than boubas and malumas, with greater effect of spikiness in drawings of symbols. Thus, drawings are modulated by context, not just superficially, but in the very feature of shape investigated in standard experiments. Our approach highlights the construction of meaning in context, a creative process that might have been crucial to forming the first words.",

        "summary": "A script is \u201ca set of graphic characters used for the written form of one or more languages\u201d (ISO 15924). What determines the visual complexity of the characters? What are the effects of inventory size (number of characters in a script), type (linguistic units represented by the script\u2019s characters), and phylogenetic influence (which script did they come from and geographic localization)? Do characters become simpler when they belong to scripts that have been exposed to evolutionary pressures for longer amounts of time? We tested those hypotheses using a standardized collection of 47,880 pictures from 133 writing systems, and two measures of visual complexity (algorithmic and perimetric). Our results support that (1) the size of a script\u2019s inventory influences character complexity, (2) one of the main determinant of character complexity is the script\u2019s type (e.g., alphabetic, syllabic). Our results also showed evidence in favor of a surprising lack of evolutionary change.",

It has been argued before that this variety partly arises from different theories of language. I argue that another important factor underlying disparate, sometimes incommensurate approaches are different understandings and definitions of 'evolution', including 'what counts as evolution' and 'what evolution can explain'. I therefore suggest that greater attention to discussions about evolution in the philosophy of biology may help untangle and clarify differences and similarities between approaches and foster constructive discussions between approaches in the field of Language Evolution.",

In other words, what ``vocal'' actually is. In a sense, this should not be important, if what is interesting about the phenotype is the learning. But in practice this issue goes beyond terminology: it rigidly constrains what different researchers count as behavior worth studying, and has ramifications that go from phylogeny to neurobiology and beyond. We discuss the implications of this state of affairs for the classification of different species regarding vocal learning, for the study of its underlying neurobiology, and for devising evolutionary theories of this phenotype and other, closely related ones, with human language as an important case.",

The neurophysiologist WH Calvin asked this question in 1982 and is the origin of the language-throwing hypothesis. There is some supporting evidence from comparative research with chimpanzees (Hopkins, Russell & Schaeffer, 2012) and if true, this hypothesis provides an additional window into the selective pressures and processes involved in language evolution.\nThis talk presents a novel experimental method and results testing this idea in humans using a Dual Task interference experiment. Participants were asked to throw balls at a target while simultaneously vocalising under 4 conditions: Silence (control), Grunt, Simple Word, Complex Word. Multiple outcome variables and throwing dynamics were analysed. A small, but statistically significant effect indicated interference in participants ability to synchronise movements with vocalisations under the Complex Word condition. Implications will be discussed.",

We build a minimalistic computational model containing only the two core features chunking and sequence memory and test its capacity to identify sentence borders and parse sentences in two artificial languages. The model has no prior linguistic knowledge and learns only by reinforcement of the identification of meaningful units. In simulations, the model turns out to be successful at its tasks, indicating that it is a good starting point for an extended model with ability to process and extract grammatical structure from larger corpora of natural language. We conclude that a model with the features chunking and sequence memory, that should in the future be complemented with the ability to establish hierarchical schemas, has the potential of describing the emergence of grammatical categories through language learning.",

        "summary": "As the distances between elements in human language sequences increase, the mutual information (MI) between them decays following a power law. This power-law relationship has been variously attributed to syntax, semantics, and discourse structure. However, the vocalizations of numerous phylogenetically distant species including humpback whales and songbirds also demonstrate similar long-range statistical dependencies. These observations support the hypothesis that long-range statistical dependencies found in human speech can occur independently of linguistic structure. To test this hypothesis, we computed MI over several child speech corpora (6 months \u2013 12 years) to determine whether long-range relationships are present in human vocalizations prior to the production of syntactically-rich speech. We find that the developmental emergence of long-range statistical dependencies in human speech precedes the production of the linguistic structures hypothesized to generate them. This suggests that the long-range statistical organization of human speech is independent of human language syntax, semantics, or discourse structure.",

Moving to the spoken modality allows us to test hypotheses concerning links between perception/production biases and  the structure of spoken languages. We test the intriguing proposal that certain typologically unusual properties of the consonant inventories of the Australian aboriginal languages represent an adaptation to the high prevalence of chronic middle-ear infections in aboriginal Australian children. We run iterated learning experiments with acoustic filters simulating the partial hearing loss associated with such infections, which provide preliminary empirical support for a causal link between perceptual constraints and typologically interesting aspects of the phonology of Australian languages.",

A number of bat species have shown indications of vocal learning-related phenotype, providing a unique opportunity to study a diversity of phenotype within the same order. \nIn this study, we are harnessing this diversity by testing gene expression in the brains of several bat species, spread over multiple families. Furthermore, we will compare these expression patterns to known patterns from other animals, using public literature on histology data of gene expression patterns (mRNA or protein expression). To this end, we aim for a better understanding of the molecular and neurogenetic properties of bat species with vocal leaning capabilities, and to identify common characteristics that are shared with evolutionary distant species.",

        "summary": "Comparative studies on animal rhythmic behaviour can help understand the evolutionary origins of rhythmic cognition underlying many human behaviours, including speech and conversational interaction. In seal pups, who are born and weaned in large breeding colonies on land, vocal rhythmicity can be functionally explained by their socio-ecology: a pup calling for its mother's attention may avoid acoustic masking by vocalizing in turns with nearby conspecifics. Here we disentangle different aspects of seal pup rhythmic cognition, to get a better picture of individual timing strategies in turn-taking choruses. We present data from four studies on harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), testing rhythmic perception, production, and interactivity. We conclude that seals both perceive and produce vocal rhythmicity without explicit training, and show how pinnipeds can usefully be studied as models for convergently evolved rhythmic traits.",

Both are often conceptualized as belonging to seemingly irreconcilable \u2018camps\u2019. Biolinguistic approaches assume that the ability to acquire language is based on a language-specific genetic foundation. Usage-based approaches, on the other hand, stress the importance of domain-general cognitive capacities, social cognition, and interaction. However, there have been a number of recent developments in both camps which suggest that biolinguistic and usage-based approaches are actually moving closer together. This relates especially to developments in three key areas, which we will discuss: a) the brain mechanisms involved in language and the degree to which the brain is specialised for processing language, b) the dynamic relationship of biology, experience and culture in the acquisition of language, and c) the interaction of cultural and biological factors in the evolution of language.",

We used two tasks: an interaction task in which dyads alternate the role of Director and Matcher to communicate about unfamiliar 3D objects, and a naming task before and after the interaction in which they individually labelled these objects. Analysis of the naming task data revealed an increase in the semantic similarity of descriptions from pre to post interaction, indicating convergence in naming practices. Analyses of the interaction task show that when creating shared labels for novel objects, interactants align in their iconic gestures as well as their lexical choice, and these two types of alignment are correlated with each other. These findings underscore the role of interaction and strategic multimodal alignment as important resources for the emergence of novel shared symbols.",

We further argue that only one hypothesis, what we are calling the Social Interaction Hypothesis, can explain the data collected to date on the truly communicative point type.",

        "summary": "Across languages, words follow a Zipfian distribution. While the source of such distributions is heavily debated, less work has examined their implications for language learning. Specifically, words are more predictable in Zipfian distributions compared to uniform ones: this greater predictability could enhance learning. Here, we explore the possible cognitive advantage of Zipfian distributions using the notion of efficiency (the ratio between observed unigram entropy and maximal entropy for the same set size). We first show that efficiency values are strikingly similar for child-directed speech in 15 languages from eight language families, suggesting that languages deviate from the uniform in similar ways. We then show that word segmentation in both children and adults is facilitated under similar efficiency values. These novel findings suggest that the efficiency values found in natural language provide an optimal environment for learning. We discuss the possible role of cognitive pressures in the emergence of such distributions.",

Some reseachers suggest that subordinate clauses are more conservative in word order than main clauses, whereas others claim that subordinate clauses are more innovative, or that there is no difference at all. A second issue is the direction of word order change. Some theories posit a preference for early head recognition, hence early V positions. Theories of dependency length minimization tend to predict a V-medial placement. Predictability maximization theory supports a V-final ordering, since this configuration can maximize the predictibility of the head.",

Key elements of infant speech acquisition are the ability of vocal production learning and the pronounced practice phase called canonical babbling. We introduce a promising candidate for comparative research on vocal ontogeny in mammalian vocal production learners: the bat Saccopteryx bilineata. During their ontogeny, pups exhibit a conspicuous vocal practice phase with a strong similarity to canonical babbling. We investigated the vocal ontogeny of 20 pups to analyze if pup babbling is characterized by the same features defining infant canonical babbling. We demonstrate that pup babbling is defined by the same features e.g. rhythmicity, repetitiveness, and overproduction. In conclusion, our study provides the first qualitative comparison of babbling features across vocal learning mammals and is the first step for future neurogenetic studies.",

We propose a modified sender-receiver/signalling game with a parameter that defines the agents' preferences between fully cooperative and fully competitive. We train computer agents using modern techniques in machine learning to play the game and in doing so develop a communication protocol from scratch. We find that the resulting agents naturally learn an effective communication protocol for scenarios that are more cooperative than competitive. For more competitive scenarios, we find that our standard learning rule is not sufficient and unstably emerges ineffective communication. We find that performance is improved when using a complex learning rule that imbues agents with theory-of-mind, allowing better communication to emerge in highly competitive scenarios.",

Several models suppose that we associate these units and compile them into chunks of information (see Perruchet & Vinter, 2002; McCauley & Christiansen, 2019). Chunking mechanisms are likely to be present in many non-human species and a comparative approach can help understand the dynamics of these general and fundamental mechanisms. In a recent experiment (Tosatto, Nemeth, Fagot & Rey, submitted), eighteen Guinea baboons (Papio papio) repeatedly produced the same motor sequence composed of 9 elements during 1000 successive trials. The evolution of response times for each element of the sequence revealed chunking patterns that evolved during the course of learning, from a concatenation of small chunks into larger ones. These results provide new evidence on the dynamics of chunking processes in non-human primates and on the mechanisms involved in chunking and associative learning.",

Comparing the cultural transmission of animal dialects with those of humans may facilitate our understanding of shared underlying neural mechanisms for dialect acquisition and preservation. Here, we present data on song dialects in a vocal learning bat, the greater sac-winged bat Saccopteryx bilineata. Pups of this species learn to sing by imitating songs of adult males during ontogeny. Since vocal imitation is not 100% accurate, acoustic differences accumulate over time, thus resulting in pronounced regional dialects which are stable for several years. Our work highlights bats as a promising taxon for studying the acquisition and preservation of learned song dialects in mammals, thus enabling future comparative research with human dialects.",

In the current paper, I indeed argue for the strong link between language syntax and musical rhythm by showing that the same neurocognitive mechanisms implemented in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical (CBGT) circuits are involved in and necessary for flexible motor and cognitive control crucial for both domains. Moreover, I propose that phylogenetic changes in the CBGT circuits led to the gradual transition from goal-directed, reward-based motor control to more flexible motor and cognitive control.",

Results from Experiment 1 show that for the RNN learners, i-complexity affected the speed of learning, with the low i-complexity paradigm being learnt more rapidly; however, for human participants there was only weak evidence that low i-complexity paradigms are easier to learn. Results from Experiment 2 suggest that the benefits of lower i-complexity weaken when learning is not staged, and that lower values of e-complexity are advantageous for learning the paradigm.\nTaken together, our results cast doubt on Ackerman and Malouf\u2019s hypothesis that i-complexity drives the learnability of morphological paradigms.",

This specific \u201clanguage-ready\u201d brain also suggests infant brain is pre-wired to learn languages. At birth preverbal new-born infants are not only sensitive to their native vocal prosody and able to distinguish every phonemes, they also show adult-like structural and functional leftward asymmetry of a critical language area, the planum temporale (PT), highlighting the PT asymmetry as a marker for functional language readiness in children development prior to language exposure. In the present brain imaging MRI study conducted in 30 in vivo infant baboons (Papio anubis), we found clearly in nonhuman new-born, a human-like significant neuroanatomical asymmetry in favor of the left hemisphere for the PT surface, a brain asymmetry which increases across ages. This finding in non-linguistic primate infants strongly questions the idea that early PT asymmetry constitutes a robust marker for language-speech development in humans.",

The comparison the acoustic output of gibbons, muriqui, chimpanzees, orangutan, bonobos and human vocalizations reveal some interesting features. These observations resulting from the comparison of anatomical data and the acoustics of non-human primate vocalizations suggest that one aspect of the evolution of the sound source in primates could have been the evolution from a whistled sound source with a high F0 to a lower frequency sound source. The former is produced between large arytenoids and the latter between a larger and thicker membranous glottis. These comparative data suggest that small changes in the anatomy and physiology of the vocals folds and glottis dimensions played an important role in the evolution F0 the sound source in primates.",

As opposed to holistic languages, compositional languages provide the simplest (most compressible) way of expressing all meanings. Here we connect these results to two other ubiquitous features of human communication: noise and interactive repair. We adapt the model of Kirby et al.\u2014in which languages are passed on through iterated learning\u2014and extend it to incorporate noise and repair. We find that in the absence of a learnability pressure, the proportion of compositional languages relative to holistic languages can increase somewhat under the combination of a pressure for (i) mutual understanding (which means agents attempt to formulate interpretable signals and reach unambiguous interpretations), and (ii) minimal effort (which favours restricted repair requests over open repair requests, because the former can re-use part of the trouble-source turn).",

The idea that language evolved through sexual selection indeed goes back to Darwin already. In this paper, we set out to test whether we could detect an impact of courtship behaviour on language, by means of an between-subject experiment with 40 male participants between the ages of 18 and 25 years old, who were interviewed by a confederate, either in an attractive condition or an unattractive condition. The participants\u2019 language was assessed on various measures of linguistic complexity. Though the actual goal of the experiment was disguised, and no overt flirtation was induced, our results show that the interviewees\u2019 language was consistently higher in the attractive condition.",

        "summary": "Historical linguistics aims to determine how languages are related, group them in families and trace their changes over time. Traditionally, scholars have relied on the comparison of similar words and the discovery of regular patterns of sound correspondences in cognate words between languages of the same family. Here we use binary syntactic parameters to define distances between languages of different families across Eurasia. In this way we can compare genetic and syntactic diversity in a sample of populations speaking languages belonging to several linguistic phyla.  Our approach makes an explicit use of implication rules linking the values of parameters. The results are then compared to the distances on phonemic characters, and to those based on the genetics of the corresponding populations. Our findings reveal that in most of Eurasia genes correlate well with syntax though not with phonemes, with the exception of the Near East, where the opposite situation arises.",

        "summary": "Research suggests that sound symbolism plays a role in language change dynamics on many time scales, from developmental to evolutionary. We discuss two key issues in sound symbolism. First, what mechanism underlies its iconic mappings? A common assumption is that sound symbolism shares the mechanism with other cross-modal correspondences, but more empirical tests are required. Second, what makes a correspondence\u200b iconic? Iconicity typically presupposes some \u201cnatural\u201d universal signifier-signified resemblance, but several sound-symbolic mappings are not found in some cultures. We advance the understanding of these questions by testing whether sound-symbolic effects are bidirectional, i.e. whether sound-symbolic properties of labels affect the memory of their referents. The results suggest that sound-symbolic effects are indeed bidirectional, which (i) shows similarity to other cross-modal correspondences, which are typically assumed to be bidirectional and (ii) suggests a way for how sound-symbolic associations become robust by amplifying initial biases through their bidirectional reinforcement.",

        "summary": "Within a dataset of 25 languages, we previously reported that less probable words contain higher-information segments, arguably because greater reduction in higher-probability words not only promotes segment loss (Zipf 1949), but also leads to evolution of more common segments. Lexical access proceeds incrementally, such that early segments in a word tend to provide more information. On this basis, we predicted and subsequently found that within most languages in the dataset, lower probability words tend to have a bias toward high segment information early in the word above and beyond just having higher information overall. But not all languages in the dataset show this pattern. Here we report evidence that languages which do not show this pattern tend to have constraints on word-forms that enforce denser lexicons, such that even late segments in words contribute disambiguating information. This in turn promotes maintenance of higher segment information late in the word.",

        "summary": "Pretend play is a universal human behaviour with a wide range of effects on social, cognitive, cultural, and linguistic development. Although it has deep evolutionary roots, humans have constructed a specific developmental niche of extended immaturity which can scaffold the development of complex human skills, such as language and perspective-taking. Pretend play serves as one such scaffold in this developmental niche. It serves as a training ground for the acquisition of complex linguistic skills and skills for linguistically negotiating perspectives, but increased linguistic skills also afford more complex forms of pretend play, creating a feedback loop. As such, they also help children to practice and internalize complex cultural practices and roles. In this paper, it is argued that the cultural practice of pretend play within the human developmental niche represents an important factor that scaffolded the evolution of language.",

In this paper we synthesize older linguistic theories on the ritual origins of language with newer experimental results to present an exaptive account of both referential and structural aspects of language (particularly center-embedding). In animal ritual, functional behaviors become exaggerated and often displaced from their original context; this process has been proposed as a precursor to the development of arbitrariness in symbolic representation. Human and animal rituals also feature center-embedding of one action sequence within another. Further evidence for the prelinguistic nature of recursion comes from recent studies of animal cognition, in which non-human species have been found to be capable of either recognizing or producing center-embedded sequences. We discuss our current ongoing work using iterated learning tasks to elucidate the conditions under which novel center-embedded structures emerge.",

First, the animal learns discrimination between two stimuli differing in one dimension. Next, when exposed with multiple stimuli including even exaggerated trait, the animal would prefer that over the original. Here we used two experiments that showed peak shift of preference did occur in birdsong and it could be inherited through epigenetic and genetic modification. First, we trained Bengalese finch females to discriminate among different songs that differ number of trill repetition. After training, birds preferred stimuli with longer repetition than the original stimuli. Second, we measured the degree of methylation in one of the song control nuclei. Methylation was negatively correlated with a measure of song complexity. Together, given a set of gene that controls epigenetics of androgen receptor methylation, peak-shift to prefer complex songs would advance evolution of song complexity.",

        "summary": "Pragmatics is believed to be an important driver of language change. A sound theoretical understanding of the dynamics of pragmatic reasoning and the principles that may give rise to this dynamics is thus crucial to the field of language evolution. Here, we study this dynamics within the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework for recursive pragmatic reasoning. We show that the RSA recursion implements an alternating maximization algorithm, providing an optimization guarantee. However, as opposed to the widely held view that RSA dynamics maximizes expected utility, we show that it is guaranteed to improve a tradeoff between expected utility and communicative effort. These analytic results are exemplified by model simulations, which also demonstrate how expected utility may decrease in RSA dynamics. Our findings suggest that least\u2013effort optimization may give rise to pragmatic reasoning, and provide new theoretical grounds for further studying pragmatic reasoning and its role in language evolution.",

We show that when asked to draw creatures named by nonce words with iconic properties, the associated properties are infused into drawings of 'creatures', enabling other people to match the drawings back to the words that inspired them. To examine whether these iconic associations may derive from neighboring real words we compared performance of English, Spanish, and Italian, finding that performance in each language was strikingly similar. We next examined whether form-meaning associations exist in the distributional structure of each language by plugging the nonsense words into word-embedding models trained on the three languages. The results are consistent with form-to-meaning iconicity being highly distributed throughout the language rather than being driven by specific nearby words.",

        "summary": "Our research empirically identifies evolutionary processes leading to increased complexity of learned vocal behavior in a songbird model system that has long been proposed to parallel key aspects of human speech evolution. The Bengalese finch (BF) has a remarkably complex song, in which transitions between vocal units are less firmly fixed, introducing variability in song sequencing. This vocal complexity evolved during BF\u2019s domestication from the white-backed munia (WBM). We are using whole-genome sequencing of individuals within the two bird strains (11 BFs and 11 WBMs) and analytical tools from comparative and population genomics to access the relative contributions of selection processes, such as female choice for more complex songs, and demographic events, such as the major population bottleneck during domestication, shaping BF\u2019s genetic variation. Our results have the potential to guide further comparative efforts toward identifying similar patterns of evolutionary change between humans and other primates or hominid lineages (e.g. Denisovans and Neanderthals).",

        "summary": "Recent cross-linguistic studies have shown that while languages may differ quite significantly when it comes to speech rate, they are actually much closer in terms of information rate, i.e. the quantity of information they convey on average per second. The explanation is a trade-off between speech rate and the average amount of information carried by linguistic units. Overall, all languages seem to fall into a narrow range of values for their information rate, centered around 39 bits per second. Despite wide intra- and inter-speaker variation in speech rates, some weak universal functional and cognitive constraints therefore seem at play.  We frame these observations in an evolutionary perspective, looking at the micro, meso and macro scales, and rely on computational stochastic models of sociolinguistic networks to explore various evolutionary processes either preserving the aforementioned tradeoff in case of language change, or gradually increasing our long-ago ancestors\u2019 ability to convey information.",

Iconic gestures systematically varied the handshape and movement patterns used, on analogy to noun/verb contrasts in established sign languages. We find that nonsigners exhibit a strong bias to interpret handling gestures as referring to actions, and we identify an expected bias for continuous movements to be interpreted as referring to actions. When these biases are in conflict, nonsigners overwhelmingly map forms to meanings on the basis of their handshape bias.",

In this contribution, we: (i) report on longitudinal data on vocal ontogeny in harbor seal pups, (ii) complement the bioacoustic findings with results from a large anatomical dataset of larynges, and (iii) critically compare our findings with available literature on harbor seal sound production. Taken together, they suggest that phocids are good candidates for animal models in future research on the evolution of human speech.",

        "summary": "Most human communication is ostensive, and language use is the paradigmatic example. Here we offer a novel hypothesis about its gradual evolution in humans. We describe the graded distinctions between ostensive communication and other forms of intentional manipulation of mental states. On this basis, we show how ostensive communication could have evolved as a gradual empowerment of other social cognitive abilities to manipulate the mental states of others. We then describe the sort of social ecology in which ostensive communication is adaptive and evolutionarily stable. Specifically, we propose that cognitive processes specialised for ostensive communication will evolve only in a partner choice social ecology, where audience are able to withdraw their trust and select their informants with a high degree of possibility. We conclude with a novel suggestion about the nature of much non-human primate communication.",

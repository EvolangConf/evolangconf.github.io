        "summary": "An evolutionary dynamics model is investigated for the evolution of multilingual populations. The model consists of two different parts, formulated as two different evolutionary games. The first part accounts for the selection of languages based on the competition for popularity and social or economic advantages. The second part relates to the circumstance when the selection is altered, for better or worse, by forces other than competition such as public policies, education, or family influences. By combining competition with intervention, the model shows how a multilingual population may evolve under these two different sources of influences, and the languages may co-exist in evolutionarily stable multilingual forms with appropriate interventional measures. This is in contrast with the predictions from previous studies that the co-existence of languages is unstable in general, and one language will eventually dominate while all others become extinct.",

        "summary": "This study examines bodily rotation in the gesturing and display of great apes, such as in various forms of spinning, rolling, flipping, etc. The data include hundreds of examples collected online from YouTube. The results document previously identified gesture types (e.g. pirouette, somersault, rope spinning), as well as other types of behaviors like backflips and leaping 360s. These various behaviors are produced by bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans across dozens of zoos, sanctuaries, and other sites. Analysis highlights the considerable variation in the performance of rotational behaviors, which are often produced with distinctive movements tuned to particular features of the environment (e.g., ropes, swings, hills, water, floor types, various objects, etc.). The findings show that the forms of rotational behaviors are flexible and subject to creativity, suggesting that they are open-ended, perhaps comparable to human language and gesture.",

        "summary": "As opposed to lexemes, vocal iconicity in grammaticalized linguistic units is poorly understood. Relatedly, nominal classification involves semantic categories, e.g. sex, animacy and physical properties, that are usually iconic. This study investigates vocal iconicity in nominal classification systems through a genetically diverse dataset of languages, which is distributed between non-agreeing (e.g. classifiers) and agreeing (e.g. grammatical gender) systems. By statistically analyzing the nominal classes\u2019 semantic scope and contained speech sounds, we were able to assess whether certain types of sounds were overrepresented in certain class meanings. The results revealed that the strongest overrepresentations of sounds were found in categories that pertained to shape and size which aligned with previous findings. However, the iconic effects were restricted to non-agreeing systems. Consequently, vocal iconicity is present in nominal classification, but substantial phonetic erosion and semantic bleaching of agreeing systems dismantles the sound component of vocal iconicity and causes mappings to break down.",

        "summary": "The neuronal recycling hypothesis posits that cultural inventions invade evolutionarily adapted neural circuitry and facilitate predictable neurological development in humans. We present an account of speech acquisition as derived from that same set of proposed principles. Applied to speech development, the hypothesis predicts (1) observable neural biases and abilities of communicative learning continuous across primates, (2) patterns of cross\u2013culturally expectable phonological development in human infants, and (3) principled manifestation of speech and systems of speech (e.g., phonology) across human cultures. All three are supported by empirical work in primatology, neurolinguistics, developmental psychology, and phonetics. Empirically testable hypotheses for developmental neuroscience are presented and implications for speech ontogenesis are discussed. The present work adds to the understanding of systems of speech as products of cultural evolution.",

The separability of these neural systems supports models of the evolution of speech and language in which song-based communication was an early foundational stage.",

This paper evaluates the underpinnings and predispositions for these developments. We contend that inter-subjective trust heightens the efficacy of cognition in semiotic inference. Human trust has particularly deep evolutionary antecedents in the entanglement of social and personal domains within cultural and biological factors. Millions of years of primate and hominin mind-reading (ToM) laid down tracks for an eventual transition to human speech using the same inferential socio-cognitive channels (at very different levels).",

On the other hand, redundancy may be useful in aiding learning and increasing a language\u2019s robustness. In the present paper, we (a) assess how frequent redundancy really is, both in terms of number of strategies available in a language, and in terms of redundant marking of specific relations within individual utterances, and (b) discuss the usefulness of redundancy in light of the competition between efficiency versus robustness. Our test case is participant role disambiguation in English and Dutch, specifically the interaction of constituent order, case, prepositional marking, and agreement to distinguish agents and recipients in ditransitive clauses. Using evidence from corpora of present day Dutch and English as well as data from Middle English, we find that redundancy is prevalent, albeit within certain limits.",

        "summary": "Aerosol particle emissions from speech are thought to play a key role in airborne pathogen transmission, though relatively little is known about the mechanisms through which articulatory gestures produce aerosol particles. We describe a novel method that allows for the more precise isolation of the production of aerosol particles during speech. We demonstrate that many particles are produced during speech, some of which are smaller than those detected with previous approaches, while also associating aerosol bursts with specific articulatory gestures. Combined aerosol and phonetic analysis illustrates how this approach can shed light on the mechanisms through which aerosols are generated during speech. We discuss ongoing efforts to further refine this method. In relationship to language evolution, this work highlights the possibility that certain articulatory gestures could have \u201cmaladaptive\u201d characteristics, in that they might generate inordinate numbers of aerosols. We stress that more experimental research is required to address this possibility.",

        "summary": "Across languages, words follow a Zipfian distribution. While the source of such distributions in language is debated, less work has examined their possible implications for language learning. Here, we explore the learnability consequences of Zipfian distributions for word segmentation, a crucial aspect of early language acquisition. We propose and test the prediction that Zipfian distributions are facilitative because of their lower unigram entropy. We start by quantifying unigram entropy (using efficiency, a normalized entropy measure) in child-directed speech across 15 languages. We find that efficiency spans a surprisingly narrow range across languages. We then show that segmentation is uniquely facilitated under similar efficiency values. These findings suggest that the efficiency values found in natural language provide an optimal environment for learning. We discuss the possible role of cognitive pressures in the emergence of such distributions.",

The reason for this is that linguistic communication requires trust since it is typically not backed up by direct evidence. According to Dor, Knight, and Lewis (2014, p. 4), virtually all researchers agree that an unprecedented level of collective cooperation and trust was needed for the first steps toward the evolution of language to occur. This paper aims to show that this dominant assumption is unnecessary and unwarranted.",

By merging elements, CS builds a hierarchical phonological representation for each morpheme before it is stored in the lexicon. In PfP, as in syntax, precedence is the natural result of interpreting head-dependent relations between units in a structure. To challenge the common assumption that analysing phonological processes relies on precedence, this paper focuses on a type of vowel metathesis in Nagoya Japanese, which is typically analysed as a swapping process operating between adjacent vowels (e.g., ai, ae \u2192 ja\u02d0). PfP, however, rejects any analysis based on metathesis, and instead regards the process as coalescence, in which two sounds merge into one by combining their properties (\u2018resonance\u2019 elements). This analysis strengthens the claim that precedence is not a formal property anywhere in the language faculty.",

This syntactic capacity has been argued to be a key feature distinguishing language from any other non-human animal communication system. However, recent evidence suggests syntax might be evolutionary more ancient with its origins deeply rooted in the primate lineage. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally investigating the presence of syntactic-like structuring in chimpanzees, our closest-living relatives. Chimpanzees produce \u201calarm-hoos\u201d when surprised or frightened and \u201cwaa-barks\u201d when potentially recruiting other group members during aggression or hunting. We show the \u201calarm-hoo + waa-bark\u201d combination represents a compositional syntactic-like structure, where the meaning of the sequence is derived from the meaning of its parts, indicating the cognitive building blocks facilitating syntax were already present in our last common ancestor with chimpanzees and are perhaps even older.",

Combinatoriality is absent only in a handful of natural languages, such as ABSL, an emergent sign language that developed in a village setting (Sandler et al. 2011). The emergence of another design feature of language, compositionality, has been explained as a trade-off between learning biases for compressibility and communication pressure against ambiguity operating over cultural transmission (Kirby et al. 2015). We test two hypotheses: (H1) Combinatoriality also results from a similar trade-off. (H2) Population structure explains differences in combinatoriality across languages.",

The former indicates a negative relationship between the length of a behaviour and its frequency. The latter describes a negative correlation between the number of behaviours in a sequence and the average length of behaviours composing it. In chimpanzee play gesture sequences Menzerath's law appears to hold, but the chimpanzee play repertoire represents a rare failure of Zipf's law. In chimpanzee sexual solicitation gestures we detected an opposite pattern to Zipf\u2019s law of brevity and no clear evidence for Menzerath\u2019s law. Our results challenge the view that compression is a universal principle in animal communication, as it does not act on a communicative system uniformly: conflicting results arise when data from the same gesture types performed by the same individuals over the same period are collected in different contexts.",

According to the human self-domestication hypothesis, this unique set of traits, and specifically our sophisticated linguistic abilities, may be the result of an evolutionary process of self-induced domestication, in which humans have evolved to be less aggressive and more cooperative. Notably, the only other species that has been argued to be self-domesticated besides humans so far is Bonobos, resulting in a narrow scope for investigating this theory beyond the primate family. \r\n\r\nHere, we propose a new animal model for studying self-domestication: the elephant. First, we motivate our hypothesis with an extensive cross-species comparison which suggests that elephants indeed exhibit many of the features associated with self-domestication (e.g., increased prosocial behavior, extended juvenile period, complex vocal behavior). Next, we present novel genetic evidence to support our proposal, showing that (1) genes positively selected in elephants are enriched in pathways that are involved in domestication, and (2) that several candidate genes associated with domestication have been positively selected in elephants.\r\n\r\nTogether, our findings underpin the idea that elephants, like humans and bonobos, may have been self-domesticated. We discuss several explanations for what may have triggered a self-domestication process in the elephant lineage, and discuss the implications of our theory to the field of language evolution.",

Experiments with Formica ants revealed essential characteristics of natural communications such as information transmission rates, flexibility, and ability to grasp regularities and use them to compress and optimize messages.

The process of determining the meaning of an expression involves a saying/implicating circle, which is thought to develop eventually into a structure of hermeneutic circle. We developed a coordination game with messages that simplifies the denotation and connotation based on the framework of experimental semiotics. Furthermore, while developing a computational model that performs as well as humans, we found several mechanisms underlying the primitive circle. Computational models that deal with both literal and implied meanings can form symbol systems faster than computational models that only deal with literal meanings. In addition, a mechanism that changes the action probability before acting based on the literal and implied meanings inferred from the symbols is necessary for the realization and mutual action coordination at a low cost.",

Based on social variables from D-Place and the use of linear mixed models controlling for language family and geographic area as random effects, and considering interaction between social and environmental variables, we show that political autonomy, high population densities, the existence of ethnic boundaries such as clans and greater reliance on agriculture are positively associated with areas with high linguistic densities. As the concentration of distinct languages and linguistic families in an area is ultimately dependent on migration, diversification, and the long-term sustainability of local diversity, these results suggest that social, political and economic factors are relevant in creating greater autonomy and boundaries that act as triggers of language splits and/or as buffers to language shift. Thus, we suggest that greater autonomy for indigenous self-governance is fundamental to the sustainability of the world\u2019s linguistic and cultural diversity.",

In the current research, we elucidate how the variation and geographical distribution of accent patterns have been formed since their divergence from the common ancestral dialect. In particular, we aim to (1) infer the transition rates between accent patterns and (2) reconstruct the phylogenetic tree of accent systems at different locations. Specifying the accent patterns of multiple locations over Japan\u2019s mainland, we develop a mathematical model of Bayesian statistics to analyze the spatial data. Modeling the past diffusion of accent patterns in the network of human populations, we obtain the posterior distribution of transition rates among accent patterns, the range of spatial interaction between populations, and the phylogenetic relationship among present dialects.",

More fundamental, however, is the capacity to produce and perceive acoustic sequences. The sequentially complex vocalizations of songbirds have long served as a potential bridge between human language and animal vocalizations, with much of the historical evidence coming from field studies. Here we show in laboratory studies that budgerigars, a psittacine, can discriminate changes in the sequence of syllables in their warble and other sound sequences while several species of songbirds tested on these and other sound sequences cannot. These results suggest perceptual limitations may play a larger role than previously thought in the differences between songbird and human acoustic communication systems.",

Given its large, diverse repertoires, used by all apes to achieve their day-to-day goals, gestural communication is a promising system for studying pragmatics in nonhuman species. Here, we establish a theoretical case, reviewing existing research on nonhuman communication to extract pragmatics where possible, and use this as a jumping off point from which to offer suggestions on ways of studying pragmatics in non-human species. We make specific recommendations in regards to recording and extracting data on different types of context, such as behavioural, social, and environmental contexts, including how we may operationalise these. We propose that broadening our view to include the context in which signals are deployed will provide new insight into understanding non-human communication from their perspectives.",

These close links and the feedback loop between language and cooperation suggest that these two traits co-evolved during their evolutionary emergence. Here, we test the hypothesis that people are more likely to cooperate with individuals that align with them linguistically. In our experiment, participants communicated with two interaction partners (which were in fact standardized chat bots), one of which syntactically aligned their language with the participants and one of which didn\u2019t. Afterwards, participants decided with which of the two partners they would like to play a cooperation game that determined the financial bonus that they would receive for participation. Against our predictions, linguistically aligned communication partners were not preferred as cooperation partners over non-aligned communication partners. This suggests that syntactic linguistic similarity may be less relevant for the outcome of negotiations than previously expected.",

While the prevalent approach in computational historical linguistics uses cognate sets as phylogenetic characters, the recent diversification of the Japonic languages poses a challenge as lexical diversity is fairly limited. This study present a new phlyogenetic analysis of 93 Japonic varieties through a combination of cognacy and phonotactics. The combined analysis of lexical and phonotactic traits was able to both capture language relationships accurately, while also considerably decreasing the overall uncertainty in the model, suggesting that non-lexical data can be a valuable addition to analyses that aim to untangle fine-grained phylogenetic structures in contexts of recent diversification. We provide an overview of the strengths of the method used, and the resulting phylogenetic tree of the Japonic language family.",

The minimal lateral network approach by List et al. or an mixture-model approach by Verkerk are only two examples for the detection of linguistic transfers and the reconstruction of linguistic networks. However, network reconstructions are still in their infancy and no standard has been established so far.\nWe aim to incorporate horizontal transfer into phylogenetic models to infer rooted and timed linguistic networks based on a birth-death process. This novel process will be integrated in an open-source Bayesian phylogenetic framework and applied the Polynesian language family to evaluate and quantify the effects horizontal transfer has on different aspects of language from the grammar to the lexicon.",

However, the overrepresentation of some species or populations, and differences in definitions, methodology and context, distort our ability to make phylogenetic comparison. This systematic review describes the current landscape of data available from studies of spontaneous gestural communication in human and nonhuman primates that make an explicit connection to language evolution. Few studies included more than one species, thus, investigation of similarities and distinctions across primate taxa is almost entirely dependent on comparison across studies, but methodologies were highly varied and definitions not always transparent. There is substantial scope for future research including: i) explicitly testing of evolutionary hypotheses in our empirical work; ii) data from diverse species, social groups, and environments, iii) natural use of gesture forms in humans and gesture ontogeny in non-human primates.",

        "summary": "Typological data shows a tendency for languages to exhibit harmonic (i.e. consistent) ordering between heads and dependents. However, some categories seem to contradict this tendency. Here we investigate one such case, the order of the noun with respect to two dependents\u2014adjectives, which tend to follow the noun and genitives which precede. We report two silent gesture experiments examining (i) whether there are cognitive biases favouring postnominal adjective and prenominal genitive order in a single trial judgement task, and (ii) if those preferences continue to influence order when participants learn a complete word order system. Our results shed light on how biases for individual categories of elements interact with biases that affect the wider linguistic system. While participants strongly prefer postnominal adjectives and prenominal genitives when these are judged in isolation, when they learn a system of ordering, these biases are obscured and (at least in some cases) harmony emerges.",

Ritual activity is unique in its emphasis on structural form and proper execution over semantic/functional content. Staal claimed Vedic ritual was recursive, based on its center-embedded symmetries. Here we trace the ubiquity of such structural principles in literary and musical composition throughout history at every level of analysis to argue that these persist as remnants of ritual culture. We also present the results of a corpus study showing that center embedding is more frequent in head-final languages, and raise the possibility that even in head-initial languages, center embedding is more common than assumed. Taken together, the evidence we present suggests that center embedding is alive and well in human language and culture today, and has likely been prevalent throughout the history of our species.",

        "summary": "All human languages change over time, as linguistic variants are discarded, innovated, and their meanings shifted. Most change stems from variation, be it geographical, cultural or social. Here we examine a source of variation intersecting these categories: political polarization. Social and political scientists have been concerned with the causes and social effects of increasing media polarization and partisan segregation, particularly in the US. However, polarization may also have an effect on the dynamics of language evolution and change, forming the basis for signals of in-group and out-group status, potentially leading to more dramatic language speciation at deeper timescales. We collect an extensive corpus of users and social media posts to computationally quantify divergence in American English along the left-right axis, both in terms of conversation topics and lexical semantics. We emphasize the potential for studies of this kind to shed light on the interplay of interacting evolutionary dynamics at socio-cultural and linguistic levels.",

This is a complex adaptive strategy for maintaining the vertically transmitted system while quickly and efficiently accepting new \u2018packages of information\u2019 useful for survival (of both the language and its speakers). The process is akin to \u2018conjugation\u2019 in horizontal gene transfer as it is a fitness-increasing strategy, found across the animal kingdom, although this specific configuration, predicated on combinatorial and phonotactic phonology is (human) language-specific. Special attention will be given to the placement of tones on loanwords. A corpus of over 200 loanwords is analyzed as part of this study.",

        "summary": "Computational models of language evolution offer important insights for explaining the emergence and evolution of human languages. However, such models have recently been criticized for being computationally intractable. The goal of this paper is to show that this criticism is misleading because it reduces all models of language evolution to only a specific subset of models that assume that the basic unit of cultural transmission is the language itself, which leads to astronomically large hypothesis spaces. In fact, there is already decades worth of computational modelling using the Language Game paradigm that has successfully addressed the issue of scaling by treating language as a complex adaptive system that spontaneously evolves as the side-effect of local communicative interactions. This paper explains why the Language Game method scales so well, and how it incorporates insights from constructivist usage-based learning and  Relevance theory.",

        "summary": "In their study, Edmiston et al. (2018), suggest that some phonological words can emerge through repeated imitations of environmental sounds; however, the universality of these findings has not been tested beyond the native speakers of the English language. Our study extends this approach to participants from two language families, Indo-European (Polish and German) and Sino-Tibetan (Chinese). Data was collected in a classic iterated learning paradigm, (8 chains of 8 participants/generations in each tested language). We expected that if imitations become more language-like, then the last (8th) generation should be more word-like than the 1st generation. Paired samples t-tests revealed a significant difference between the orthographic transcription similarity means from the 1st and 8th generations in the expected direction only in the Polish language. Minimally, care should be taken when generalizing results obtained from speakers of a single language since these can reflect language or culture-specific rather than language-universal phenomena.",

        "summary": "The right posterolateral portion of the cerebellum is involved in language processing. However, their functional role in language remains unknown. The cerebellum is hypothesized to acquire an internal model that is a functional copy of mental representations in the cerebral cortex and to contribute to cognitive function. In this research, based on the cerebellar internal model hypothesis, we conducted task-based and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to investigate the role of the cerebellum in the syntactic aspect of comprehension of sentences. In the experiment, study participants read sentences with center-embedded hierarchical structures. Broca\u2019s area showed hierarchical level-dependent activity. Hierarchical level-dependent activity was also found in the right crus I. Resting-state fMRI demonstrated intrinsic functional connectivity between the Broca\u2019s area and the right crus I. These findings suggest that the right crus I is involved in the syntactic aspect of sentence processing.",

        "summary": "Wild chimpanzees often combine pant-hoots with buttress drumming. Chimpanzees drum on buttress roots of trees, generating low-frequency sounds that can reach distances of over a kilometre. We investigated whether individual differences exist in drumming bouts produced by male chimpanzees of the Waibira community in the Budongo Forest in Uganda, and whether individual, contextual, and social factors affected their use of drumming. We found individual differences in drumming bouts produced during traveling, but no differences in those produced during displays. Pant-hoot drumming combinations were mainly produced during travel. Chimpanzees drummed most frequently while traveling and in smaller party sizes. Signaller age or the social composition of the party had no effect on the use of drumming. Our findings reveal the flexibility of buttress drumming across social and behavioural contexts and suggest that, by encoding individual identity during travel, drumming may be incorporated in pant-hoots to facilitate chimpanzee fission-fusion dynamics.",

In a Turing test stripped of natural language, we manipulated bot behavior to assess how it affects the detection of bots, and participants\u2019 behaviors. Our main hypothesis was that access to past interactions makes bots more deceptive by interrupting the successful formation of conventions.\nParticipants in the experiment had to distinguish between their human partner and a bot using only virtual movements. By comparing bots imitating behavior from the same or a different dyad, we show that bots can avoid human detection and prevent conventional interactions from succeeding by imitating participants' human partners. Additionally, reciprocal interaction was only useful when conventional interaction was blocked. Taken together, the results show how manipulating the behavior of artificial agents can provide new insights into the emergence of human communication.",

To disentangle the patterns of demographic and cultural transmission systematically, here we assembled a new genomic database (GeLaTo, GEnes and LAnguages TOgether) specifically curated to investigate genetic and linguistic diversity worldwide. We find that most populations in GeLaTo which speak languages of the same language family (i.e. that descend from the same ancestor language) are also genetically highly similar. However, we also identify nearly 20% mismatches scattered around the world, suggesting that they are a regular outcome in human history. Moreover, the genetic and linguistic divergence times of population pairs match only rarely, with Indo-European standing out as a family with more matches than any other. Together, our database and findings pave the way for systematically disentangling demographic and cultural history.",

The letter-sound correlation was examined in six phonograms (Arabic, Cyrillic, English, Hebrew, and Korean), one logogram (Chinese), two artificial orthographies (The Shavian Alphabet and Pitman\u2019s shorthand), and two fictitious orthography systems. We measured all the pairwise phonological distances between phonemes in the respective alphabet system, and the corresponding pairwise orthographical distances between letters. We then tested Pearson\u2019s r between these two lists of pairwise distances. The positive correlation coefficient means that similar letter shapes have similar canonical pronunciations. We verified the significance of the correlations by conducting Monte-Carlo permutation tests. We found the significant grapho-phonemic systematicity for all conventional writing systems and two English shorthand systems. Those fictitious alphabets did not show any systematicity. We discuss the results in connection with the evolution of orthography systems and its implication in language acquisition.",

        "summary": "Human languages have an open-close mouth rhythm of 2-7Hz, which is essential for our understanding of speech. This rhythm has also been reported in chimpanzee lip-smacks and whilst it is known to have rhythm variations, what drives this variation is unknown. We created a machine learning model using DeepLabCut to track wild chimpanzee facial movement to detect lip-smack rhythm across 2 communities. Using this model, we found a chimpanzee\u2019s community, sex, age, relative rank or the sex of their grooming partner does not affect lip smack rhythm. Instead, it seems highly flexible, with individuals showing large variation in lip-smack rhythm. This suggests the behaviour is not innate and chimpanzees control their lip-smack rhythm, contributing to the growing body of evidence that speech evolution began outside of the hominoid lineage. Variation between bouts for the same individual, alongside variation within the bout itself, suggest that the rhythm encodes a behavioural function.",

This change has been acknowledged as an important step towards modern human phonetics. However, to date there is little reflection about how to conceive such a drastic evolutionary change within the subtribe Hominina. Here we propose the theoretical integration of air sacs loss as a case of phenotypic accommodation, a notion that helps to understand how our ancestors managed to survive, accommodating and consolidating the phenotype without air sacs,  paving the way for a new phonetic system.",

We expand on existing simulations to explore the self-domestication hypothesis, which suggests that increased prosociality led to the sophistication of the cultural niche and enabled the complexification of languages. In our model, robots engaged in a foraging task while playing a language game, with two critical novel features: robot individuation and parameterizable prosociality. We show that these manipulations lead to the formation of a classic \u201cin-group bias\u201d - a bias which is highly common in social animals in nature but that was so far absent from swarm robotics models. Next, we observe that higher prosociality values result in the collection of more resources, potentially indicating an evolutionary advantage. Finally, we show that prosociality modulates the effect of physical distance on lexical convergence, with low innate prosocially leading to more stable sub-swarm divergence, even in relative proximity.",

However, humans currently represent a large gap in the great ape gesture research puzzle. Here we demonstrate successful use of a novel \u2018proof-of-concept\u2019 experiment in which participants view videos of 10 chimpanzee gestures performed by expert human experimenters. We asked participants to select the \u2018correct\u2019 gesture meaning from one of four responses for each video. As chimpanzees flexibly use some gestures for multiple meanings, gesture responses were either Tight (1 correct, 3 random); or Flexible (2 correct, 2 random). Binomial tests from n=300 participants revealed significant adherence to chimpanzee responses for the overall experiment, and in 6 out of 10 gesture types (1 Tight and 5 Flexible). Our novel design supports the hypothesis that humans may retain some access to \u2018ape-typical\u2019 gestures.",

We describe consistent and variable traits of gestural communication by comparing three East African chimpanzee communities (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). Our study suggests that chimpanzee gestural communication exhibits both fixed traits (e.g., frequency in use of gestural communication across the same behavioural contexts) and cultural variation (e.g., preferences for use of certain gesture types). This is noteworthy given that human language has also been suggested to possess both universal properties: consistency across groups, as well as cultural variation in the form of accents, dialects, and languages. These additional similarities between chimpanzee gestural communication and language support the theory that great ape gestural communication may represent one of the precursors leading to the evolution of modern human language.",

        "summary": "The distribution of word orders across the world\u2019s languages is highly skewed with some word orders more than 100 times more common than others. It is commonly assumed that these word orders are preferred because they fit cognitive and communicative biases, but why do not all languages use these preferred orders? This study proposes that the use of a preferred word order in a language depends on the communicative challenges it faces. Specifically, it tests whether larger communities are more likely to use universally-preferred word order as a tool to overcome their greater communicative challenges. This was tested in a group communication game with 15 large groups, 15 small groups, and 30 solo players. Results showed increased use of preferred word orders with time, but more so in the large groups than the small group and solo conditions. Thus, cross-cultural differences in communicative challenge might govern manifestation of universal tendencies.",

Specifically, it is proposed that this seemingly language-specific operation finds its evolutionary rationale in how primate calls are formed. It is further argued that self-domestication played a significant role in the evolution of this operation. The overall proposal has the implication that basic \"divide and conquer\" comparative approaches widely taken in the evolinguistic field can be further applied to the enterprise that seeks to elucidate the evolution of specific linguistic phenomena.",

We tested the ability of neonates of a pinniped species (harbor seals) to flexibly modify their voices in response to playbacks. Our results suggest seal pups can flexibly and spontaneously adjust their fundamental frequency in response to external sounds. In other words, seal pups have good control over their vocal tract beyond what usually observed in most non-human mammals, and do not require explicit training to show this control. Overall, these experiments provide more evidence of how pinnipeds can be a fitting model species to better understand one side of speech evolution, namely vocal imitation, learning and plasticity.",

Yet, no mammalian vocal learner but humans has shown the capacity of spontaneously perceiving or producing rhythmic patterns. Here we tested untrained rhythm discrimination in a mammalian vocal learning species, harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). Twenty wild-born seals were exposed to music-like playbacks of conspecific call sequences varying in key rhythmic properties: tempo, length, and regularity. All three features significantly influenced seals\u2019 reaction (looking behavior), demonstrating spontaneous rhythm perception in a vocal learning mammal. In a second experiment, we tested a seal pup\u2019s ability to precisely and spontaneously time their calls The seal showed precise rhythmic timing, qualitatively similar to human turn-taking. This finding supports the rhythm-vocal learning hypothesis and showcases pinnipeds as promising models for comparative research on rhythm origins.",

We found a bias for the NounAdj over the AdjNoun word order for all groups, with Gesturers showing a weaker bias. We then asked (Exp3) whether the bias towards regularizing variable input may have contributed to the strong NounAdj bias among NSL cohorts. In a silent gesture perception experiment, English-speakers were trained on NounAdj and AdjNoun orders at varying frequencies. We found evidence of regularization when the majority of the training input was NounAdj, but found no evidence of regularization when training was majority AdjNoun. Our results suggest that the prominence of NounAdj word orders cross-linguistically can be attributed to a cognitive bias for NounAdj orders and a regularization bias amplifying those underlying preferences.",

Recent work shows such distributions can facilitate word segmentation, and suggests their presence may be driven (in part) by learnability pressures. Here, we ask if learners show a cognitive bias for skewed distributions using an iterated learning paradigm. In the first study, we show that speakers produce skewed word distributions in telling a novel story. In the second study, we ask if this bias leads to a shift from uniform distributions towards more skewed ones using an iterated learning paradigm. We exposed the first learner to a story where the six nonce words appeared equally often, and asked them to re-tell it. Their output served as input for the next learner, and so on for a chain of ten learners (or \"generations\"). Over time, word distributions became more skewed (had lower unigram entropy), suggesting learners have a bias for skewed distributions.",

We applied Bayesian phylogenetic methods to estimate the age of the Oceanic languages, incorporating calibration information from a new compilation of archaeological dates. These methods estimated an ancient date for Oceanic languages that conflicted with the archaeological data, analogous to the ancient dates frequently estimated by molecular clock analyses in evolutionary biology. Simulation datasets using a known phylogenetic tree with a timescale corresponding to the archaeological dates showed that under certain conditions the Bayesian phylogenetic methods will consistently overestimate the dates of nodes at the base of the tree. This calls into question ancient dates retrieved from phylogenetic analysis of linguistic or biological data when they conflict with the archaeological or fossil record respectively.",

We propose that changing communicative environments and their shifting foci of hominin-animal and hominin-hominin interaction are fundamental to understanding the evolution of language in the hominin lineage and pledge for interpretive conservatism and argue that an \u201cextended short chronology\u201d for the evolution of human language is currently best supported by the archaeological data (in sync with a prolonged period of intensified \u201cindexical\u201d communication). This evolutionary trajectory is best understood as a form of non-linear \u201cco-evolution\u201d, interlaced with key developments in multiple hominin behavioral arenas and material registers, such as animal relationships, technical behavior, artistic expression and the modalities and scale of social life. Systematically mapping and exploring this broader \u201cgeneral ecology\u201d of communicative needs, concerns, functions, and horizons requires the integration of archaeology, ethology, linguistics, and phenomenology.",

We present a 'special case of' approach, which is clearly different to existing frameworks based on a supposed hierarchy of \u2018levels of intentionality\u2019. Our main novelty is to clearly distinguish between intentionally reveals intentions (to be groomed, to play, etc), and intentionally revealing *specifically informative* intentions. The latter case os commonly called 'Gricean'. We label the former 'Ladyginian', after Nadezhda Ladygina-Kohts, who was one of the first scientists to document in a systematic way the similarities and differences between the expressive behaviours of humans and chimpanzees. Explaining the evolutionary origins of human communication requires identification of the ecological reasons why humans, and apparently only humans, transitioned from Ladyginian to Gricean modes of interaction.",

        "summary": "In sign languages, due to the affordances of visual modality to use multiple articulators and iconicity, meaning units can be organized not only linearly but also simultaneously. Recent research has shown that LIS (Italian Sign Language) signers use simultaneous constructions to achieve communicative efficiency when they are required to encode informationally rich events. In the present study, we explored whether simultaneity constitutes an emergent linguistic property evolved for greater communicative efficiency. We asked whether hearing participants using only their gestures to communicate (i.e., silent gesture) could represent multiple semantic information units of the event simultaneously to the same extent as signers. We compared descriptions of events that varied in their information density produced by 23 Italian speakers using silent gesture and 23 deaf signers of LIS. The findings showed that gesturers used simultaneity less frequently and qualitatively differently than signers. We conclude that not only linear but also simultaneous expressions of meaning units constitute an emergent property of sign languages.",

Experiment 1 addressed learnability, testing comprehension and production of small artificial languages exemplifying each dependency type in noun phrases. As expected, branching dependency grammars were the most learnable, but crossed grammars were marginally easier than center-embedding. Experiment 2 employed iterated learning to examine the emergence and stabilization of consistent grammar. The initial participant in each chain was trained on phrases generated by a random grammar; the language produced by one participant was passed to the next. Branching dependency grammar appeared in most chains within a few generations and remained stable, although one chain stabilized on output consistent with a crossed grammar; none converged on center-embedding grammars. These findings call into question the assumption that crossed dependencies are more cognitively complex than center-embedding, while confirming the role of learnability in the typology of dependency structures.",

We show that this method allows the strength of selection that favours one variant over the other to be measured reliably by comparing with previously established algorithms. By applying the method to digital corpora, we quantify the competition between simplicity at different levels of language structure, showing that pressures towards phonological simplicity may have led to irregularisation of English verbs. The method can further accurately identify times at which sudden changes in selection strength occurred due to changes in the social environment. We demonstrate this by studying the dynamics of Spanish spellings before and after official reforms. We conclude that the algorithm provides a robust means to identify the selective forces that have shaped language structure through the process of language evolution.",

        "summary": "Rhythm is a fundamental feature characterizing communicative displays, and recent studies showed that primate songs encompass categorical rhythms falling on small integer ratios observed in humans. We assessed the presence and sexual dimorphism of rhythmic categories individually, analyzing songs emitted by 39 wild indris. Considering the intervals between the units given during each song, we extracted 13556 interval ratios and found three peaks (at around 0.33, 0.47, 0.70). Two peaks indicated rhythmic categories corresponding to small integer ratios (1:1, 2:1). All individuals showed the peak at 0.70, and most showed those at 0.47 and 0.33. In addition, we found sex differences in the peak at 0.47 only, with males showing lower values than females. This work investigates the presence of individual rhythmic categories in a non-human species; further research may highlight the significance of rhythmicity and untie selective pressures that guided its evolution across species, including humans.",

Our argument rests on two steps: to argue in favor of a continuity of animal proto-conversation (PC) with modern human conversation; to show that the analysis of how PC of human infants develop into sophisticated conversational skills, in part from changes in the management of aggression/emotions, can shed light on how full-fledged conversational abilities emerged from PC in modern humans under HSD forces. Overall, we argue for a gradual transition from PC to full-fledged conversation under the gradual increase of HSD features in our species.",

In its original and most well-known manifestation, the law of abbreviation is a correlation between the length and frequency of spoken or written words. Zipf's Law of Abbreviation has been shown to hold at the level of words in many languages, but it is unknown whether it holds at the level of characters. Characters' complexity is similar to word length, requiring more effort from producing and processing the more complex symbols. We built a dataset of character complexity and frequency measures covering 27 different writing systems. Our results suggest that Zipf's Law of Abbreviation holds for every single system in our dataset \u2013 the more frequent characters have lower degrees of complexity and vice-versa. This result provides further evidence of optimization mechanisms shaping communicative systems.",

Reportedly, onomatopoeia utterances connect the impressions of sounds and abstract words. This study was conducted using classroom observations of six school-aged children to assess the effectiveness of teacher utterances using onomatopoeia for children with delayed language development. The observed children were first-grade and second-grade students of a special needs education school. We analyzed the children's responses to the teacher's instructional utterance including onomatopoeia and the instructional utterance without onomatopoeia. Overall, the children responded more to the teacher's instructions which did not include onomatopoeia. However, the responses to instructions given with onomatopoeia differed among the children. Furthermore, the children tended to behave more as the teacher intended when the teacher's instructions were given to individuals.",

Phonesthemes defy the principle of arbitrariness (that words with related meanings tend to sound dissimilar) and so should hinder our ability to avoid confusion and maintain subtle distinctions, yet there is speculation that words containing phonesthemes evolve to become more rather than less likely to refer to the corresponding feature (e.g., \u201cglacier\u201d might be associated with light). We provide evidence from two experiments that phonesthemes do indeed influence how people process the meanings of words like \u201cglacier\u201d and, furthermore, that phonesthemes speed up recognition of visually degraded words containing the corresponding feature (like \u201cglint\u201d). Phonesthemes guide semantic change and thereby reduce arbitrariness in the English lexicon, and this non-arbitrariness confers a processing advantage in noisy environments.",

It is inspired by relatively recent historical cases in which the linguistic ecology and sociohistorical context are highly complex. Pidgin and creole genesis offers an opportunity to obtain linguistic facts, social dynamics, and historical demography in a highly segregated society. This provides a solid ground for researching the interaction of populations with different pre-existing language systems, and how different factors contribute to the genesis of the lexicon of a newly generated mixed language. We take into consideration the population dynamics and structures, as well as a distribution of word frequencies related to language use, in order to study how social factors may affect the developmental trajectory of languages. Focusing on the case of Sranan in Suriname, our study shows that it is possible to account for the composition of its core lexicon in relation to different social groups, contact patterns, and large population movements.",

However, comprehensive data on gorilla gestural behaviour is limited to western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in captive environments. Here we investigated the gestural behaviour of wild mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) living in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda (n=48 individuals; 4 social groups). Ad libitum video data on social interactions was collected over 8 months (ca. 640 h of observation time) and 1651 instances of intentional gesture use were coded with the linguistic video annotation software ELAN. For each communication we coded the gesture action used, the interacting individuals, the goal, and whether it was successful. We identified a repertoire of 68 different gesture actions (including \u201cnovel\u201d gesture forms) and individuals showed a bias towards the use of contact gestures.",

        "summary": "Contrary to prior studies, our Bayesian spatiophylogenetic modeling results do not support a hypothesis that morphological complexity (boundness) is strongly influenced by the social variables, such as L1 speakers population or the proportion of L2 speakers. In contrast to previous studies, we disentangle boundness from informativity in our analyses, and our findings can be explained by the use of an extensive dataset and our rigorous control for phylogenetic and spatial non-independence of languages. As a result, the claimed link between the grammatical complexity and social variables does not appear to be strong and is found only weakly between informativity scores and some of the social variables, such as a positive effect of L1 speaker population and the official language status on informativity. This indicates that the evolution of these complexity dimensions is better explained from the perspective of inheritance and areal diffusion rather than constraints imposed by different social environments.",

        "summary": "In its various forms, communication is considered as a social activity, in which timing plays a critical role. Yet, the reciprocal contribution and evolutionary course of timing and sociality are highly debated. We argue that much of this debate is complicated by the choice of diverging definitions of sociality and timing, by the focus on partial mechanistic explanations, and by the adoption of an anthropocentric perspective. To overcome these limitations, we propose a shift towards an integrative approach on social timing allowing for neural, cognitive, physiological, and behavioural explanations to inform each other. Further, we advocate for the use of species-appropriate paradigms that can be applied with minimal changes to several species. Our aim is to provide a theoretical starting point and testable hypotheses, which will allow building evolutionary trees of social timing and, ultimately, bring us closer to explaining why humans are such social, rhythmic, and communicative animals.",

        "summary": "We propose a characterization of language that does not rest on the hypothesis that meaning is necessarily shared across interlocutors, since it is fundamentally grounded in the privacy and subjectivity of mental content. We first argue that the function of language is thus best characterized as the coordination rather than the communication between minds, since it is the constraints on use\u2014rather than on meaning itself\u2014that are negotiated between interlocutors during linguistic interactions. We then explore the evolutionary benefits of subjectivity and argue that it positively contributes to adaptability through: 1) innovation, as conceptual variability at the individual level increases the likelihood of the group of finding relevant conceptual innovations when exposed to environmental challenges; and 2) transfer, as subjective coordination allows for individual innovations to spread across a whole population, without individuals having to align their conceptual spaces and thereby lose the benefits of conceptual variability.",

Phase 1 corresponds to the period from the Homo-Pan last common ancestor to before the Oldowan stone tools: evolution of sociality and life history. Phase 2 corresponds to the period from the Oldowan and the continual expansion of Homo brain size to before the behaviourally modern humans: evolution of cognitive and learning ability. Phase 3 corresponds to the period from the behavioural modernity in H. sapiens to current music: cultural evolution. The initial origins of music were likely manipulative calls with limited musical elements. Then, the vocalizations gradually became more complex, flexible, and variable along with greater degree of social learning. Finally, artificial instruments, language faculty, and cultural sexual selection dramatically enhanced musical universality and diversity, uniquely in humans. Our musical capacity and products should have been induced by the hominin-specific combination of several biosocial features.",

Drawing on evidence for increased social connectivity in archaeology and selection against reactive aggression in early humans, we update this model by simulating inter-group contact and subjecting agents to selection pressures acting on tolerance for out-group members. We show that vocal grooming (gossip) can emerge as the dominant bonding strategy even when the assumption that clique sizes are different for gossip and grooming are relaxed. This suggests that the benefit of having information about social events drives the emergence of gossip. Moreover, the results show that the evolution of tolerance is influenced by group structure in the community. The precise interactions between different factors affecting inter-group tolerance, population dynamics and how these shape the evolution of language is what we propose to investigate further.",

        "summary": "The Planum Temporale (PT) is a key language area and is structurally and functionally left-lateralized in pre-linguistic infants. Therefore, the PT was considered a marker of the uniquely human pre-wired brain for language acquisition. This latter hypothesis has been questioned by recent studies reporting similar structural asymmetries in newborn baboons. Nevertheless, its functional implication in monkeys, and their potential shared properties with any language features related to PT asymmetry in humans remains unknown. Here, we show that direction of early PT grey matter asymmetry in newborn baboons predicts the development of later communicative gesture\u2019s manual lateralization once juveniles (but not of handedness for non-communicative manipulative action). This finding suggests that early PT asymmetry in both monkeys and humans might be a pre-wired brain marker of a shared functional feature between human language and monkey\u2019s gestural communication.",

However, they may be more stable when they span morpheme boundaries (e.g. /gz/ in egg+s): such clusters predictably indicate morphological complexity and may be stabilized in transmission by this signalling function. We examine how well these boundary crossing clusters are transmitted in comparison to those that are solely stem-internal (e.g. /mp/ in lamp), and ambiguous ones that occur both within and across morphemes (e.g. /nd/ in hand or sinn+ed). To that end, we conducted a spoken iterated artificial language learning experiment where participants learned and passed on a mini language with clusters in the different morphotactic positions. We report that only boundary crossing clusters were transmitted over numerous speaker generations, while their stem-internal and ambiguous counterparts were lost early.",

Here we deal with the exceptions to this trend (i.e., positional splits) by looking at person-number indexing morphology in 227 languages. We found that natural classes (like 1PL/2PL/3PL) are significantly overrepresented. Within unnatural classes, those with more shared values (e.g., 1SG/2SG/2PL) appear around chance levels, while those with fewer shared values (e.g., 1SG/2SG/3PL) are significantly underrepresented. In an artificial language learning experiment we found that the relative learnability of different positional split types matches their cross-linguistic frequency, being also proportional to the amount of meaning overlap. Our findings suggest a cognitive bias in category formation that might drive the morpheme order patterns observed in natural languages, and require us to rethink the natural-vs-unnatural class distinction as a gradient dimension.",

We tested the idea that relevance of hypothetical neural models could be confirmed by behavioral changes after repeated self-induction of a specific brain activity pattern assumed in the model. Through an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment, we first proposed a neuro-linguistic model that multiple brain systems would contribute to express intentions using hierarchical structures of a symbol string. Subsequent EEG neurofeedback training revealed the case showing improvement of intention-reading in a picture description task after successful training of EEG power modulation at the parietal and occipital electrodes, as well as less improvement of utilization of the hierarchical structures with less achievement of the left frontal EEG modulation. We speculate that appropriate design of the neurofeedback examination may help to understand organization and possible adaptive capacity of language systems in the brain.",

Their repertoire spans from rumbles reaching into the infrasonic range to high pitched trumpets and, in Asian elephants only, even higher pitched squeaks. How call types are produced and what information they contain has been studied in African elephants\u2019 rumbles but remains largely unknown in Asian elephants. We used an acoustic camera to visualise sound emission in captive female Asian elephants and analysed their acoustic structure. We suggest that squeaks are produced by lip-vibration, a mechanism so far only described in humans, but one female who squeaked through her narrowed nostril demonstrated within call type flexibility. Rumbles were emitted orally or nasally as described in African elephants but also simultaneously through the mouth and trunk, resulting in complex vocal tract resonances. Our results demonstrate how flexible sound production increases the parameter space available for information coding within and between call types.",

The present study uses an artificial language learning paradigm to verify the existence of learning asymmetries consistent with Neg-First preferences in English speakers. The study further incorporates a dyadic interaction task to investigate proposals that the Neg-First tendency is driven by communicative factors. Results show that learners overall produced more preverbal negation than was found in the input language, consistent with a Neg-First bias. However, the interaction task only induced greater preverbal negation use when preverbal negation was the majority word order in the input language. This does not support the idea that a communicative context induces a greater preference for preverbal negation in general.",

Given their centrality, both concepts should also play an important role in accounts of the evolutionary emergence of language and human communication. Here, we adopt an evolutionary perspective on im/politeness and face. We describe the roles of im/politeness and face in human interaction, with a special focus on the subcomponents of face: self-image, interpersonal affect, identity, and reputation. We then sketch the evolutionary benefits of im/politeness and face, highlighting their role in co-operation and group management. Lastly, we discuss aspects of face shared with other primates, especially reputation formation. We conclude that although reputation formation can be seen as an evolutionary foundation of the evolution of face, face management is uniquely expressed in language and human interaction.",

        "summary": "Generating complex meaning from continuous speech requires the neural mapping of this incoming signal onto syntactic structure. In the evolution of language, prosody might have been integral in facilitating this mapping. Here, we were interested in elucidating this mapping in human adults and tested the extent to which the prosodic features modulate oscillatory synchronization with the speech signal. To this end, we recorded participants\u2019 behavioral and electrophysiological (EEG) responses while they listened to spoken sentences. We found that the brain was sensitive to the rhythmic variations in the speech signal, tracking input more accurately when rhythm was regular compared to irregular, but equally well regardless of whether intonation had been flattened or not. This difference in sensitivity might be rooted in evolutionary history and may have influenced the functional roles rhythm and intonation take on in speech processing.",

        "summary": "Vocal development in non-human primates has received little empirical attention despite its relevance for understanding the acquisition of communicative capacities from a comparative perspective. In chimpanzees, the ontogeny of pant hoots, a multi-component and long-distance social call, is largely unknown. We examined the behavioural responses associated with received pant hoots in immature chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) of Budongo, Uganda. Immature individuals rarely produced vocal responses, however, they often produced more subtle responses such as moving the head towards the caller. When compared to mature chimpanzees, immature individuals moved their head and vocally responded less often. We show that the responsiveness of immature individuals undergoes developmental changes, varies according to sex, and is affected by social factors. Contrary to previous assumptions, our observations support a flexible and socially mediated ontogeny of primate vocal behaviours.",

New languages, however, are not born in petri dishes. Here we consider a case of potential language contact between a new sign language in Nicaragua and the spoken language with which it cohabitates: Spanish. We propose language contact as an explanation for this unanticipated shift. This situation meets Thomason (2001)\u2019s criteria for establishing contact-induced change: there is no language-internal motivation for this shift, word order is a highly borrowable linguistic feature (Bickel & Hickey, 2017; Thomason & Kaufman, 1988), and the order of nouns, numerals, and adjectives in NSL in 2015 matches Spanish order. As language contact is the norm around the world, we seek to open a discussion of what we can gain by bringing language contact to the center of our models of language evolution.",

Despite such a long-standing interest of the field, to this day there is no systemic approach to the question of language ontogeny in language evolution. This seems crucial since evolution depends on changes in ontogenetic patterns. Given advancements of relevant disciplines (evolutionary, developmental and systems biology) we argue that the time is ripe for developing such an approach and propose that translating the achievements of the Evolutionary Developmental Biology (Evo-Devo) to the field of language evolution is a particularly promising avenue for future research. In the talk, we will outline how application of this framework provides insights in the field of language evolution, stressing the multicomponent nature of language and discussing how major processes such as heterochrony and heterometry,  described in the Evo-Devo can be applied to contextualize language ontogeny in language evolution.",

It is this tight link between organisms\u2019 communicative system and cognitive abilities that is unmatched in other species and makes human language particularly \u201cstand out\u201d. In our opinion, language development provides one of the most convincing types of evidence of the connection between language and cognition in humans. We briefly outline two lines of research supporting this view and suggest that it is important not only to compare and contrast animal communication and communicative functions in human language but to explore differences in cognitive ontogeny as well as pose the question of why and how the tight link between language and cognition emerged in humans, and why it seems to be lacking in non-human animals.",

        "summary": "Verbs are central to the syntactic structure of sentences.  Children may focus on the agent of the action (Maguire et al., 2008) or the action being performed (e.g., Behrend, 1990) during verb learning; little evidence is available.  Two 1/2, 3 1/2- and 4 1/2-year-olds saw dynamic target and distractor events and heard verbs while a Tobii x30 eye tracker recorded fixations to AOIs (head/face, hands). Children across age extended the verbs to new events.  When viewing target events, children increased looking to the hands (action) as trials progressed and decreased looking to the face (less informative for verbs).  When viewing distractor events, children decreased their looking to hands and maintained their attention to the face.  This study helps reveal attentional strategies children may use when learning verbs, and could provide clues to how languages may have changed in response to the learnability of emerging predicate structures.",

However, compelling alternative explanations suggest this class of calls may be more akin to emotional outcries or even imperatives. Here, we take a novel empirical approach towards disentangling these hypotheses in the aerial predator alarm calls of meerkats. A model predator (a kite designed to look like an eagle) was presented to each of 7 groups of wild meerkats to determine whether the production of alarm calls was most associated with factors corresponding to referential, imperative or emotional hypotheses. Ultimately, we find robust evidence that the aerial alarm calls of meerkats serve a primary referential function, and cannot be explained as mere emotional outbursts or imperatives, thereby lending support to analogies between this class of calls and semantic language.",

        "summary": "Higher-frequency words are replaced and regularized less often than lower-frequency words. One hypothesis is that this is due to weaker drift at higher frequencies. The pattern may also be due to selection if cognitive and social pressures against innovation are stronger at higher frequencies. To test whether drift or selection explains the observed pattern, we ran an experiment with absolute frequency as a within-subjects independent variable and relative frequency and iconicity as between-subjects independent variables. Participants were asked to learn an artificial input language composed of four nouns referring to two referents, with each referent having two synonyms. Drift strength was manipulated as a within-subjects variable by varying the absolute frequency of the referents.\u00a0Relative frequency and iconicity were manipulated as between-subject variables. In the Baseline Condition, nouns with common referent occurred at the same relative frequency\u2014that is, at a 4:4 or a 12:12 ratio. In the Relative-Frequency Condition, nouns with a common reference occurred at different relative frequencies\u2014that is, at a 1:7 or a 1:23 ratio. The same ratio was used in the Iconicity condition, but the more common noun had high iconicity relative to the less common noun (e.g.,\u00a0onklin vs. fiflin for a pig). We measured noun replacement as change in entropy of the input and the output language. Our results suggest that both drift and selection were responsible for the higher replacement of low-frequency nouns in our experiment. Although selection had an effect on replacement in the Relative Frequency and Iconicity Conditions, replacement was higher in the low-frequency class across conditions.",

However, the forces behind why certain meanings are more likely to be expressed by the same form than others (i.e., why they colexify) are still under active investigation.\r\nThis research asks what form- and concept-based information is predictive of the maintenance or loss of colexifications over time, particularly from Latin to romance languages. To do so the largest database on cross-linguistic colexifications available to date, CLICs3, was enriched with sense data from BabelNet, one of the largest multilingual sources for structured semantic data.\r\nWe focused on the following intralinguistic features: word length, form confusability, part of speech, number of lexifications per sense, and semantic relations, and found out the most informative features were semantic relations and form confusability, leading to models with an accuracy between 80 and 90%.",

Participants were exposed to supposed new slang words in English and told they had the same meaning. The words were presented across positive, negative, and neutral contexts, and we manipulated their contextual distribution. After exposure, participants were given sentences with blanks and asked to fill each blank with one of the slang words. Across conditions participants differentiated the synonyms regardless of whether or to what extent they had differentiated by context in the exposure phase. Differentiation was however stronger when the exposure sentences had unambiguously differentiated the slang words. We take this as evidence that the dearth of absolute synonymy in natural languages is in large part driven by cognitive biases against treating different words as referring to precisely the same thing.",

        "summary": "Language change is often studied by investigating trajectories of token frequencies, e.g., of words. In this contribution, we promote the use of prevalence for studying lexical change, i.e., the fraction of individuals that know and use a word. Lexical prevalence was employed in mathematical accounts of lexical spread and, more recently, considered in psycholinguistic research where prevalence was argued to function as relevant (control-)variable in experimental setups. Building on an empirical analysis of diachronic corpus data and mathematical population-dynamic models, we show (a) that lexical prevalence is relevant for studying the spread of lexical innovations in that prevalence trajectories typically precede frequency trajectories, and we propose (b) the use of coupled dynamics of prevalence and frequency.",

        "summary": "Two mechanisms involving negative frequency dependence, i.e., pressures for less of the same, have been suggested to affect linguistic evolution: (i) horror aequi, a cognitive-psychophysiological effect that leads to avoidance of repetitions, and (ii) extravagance, which is a pragmatic strategy to signal non-conformity and emphasis by avoiding predominant constituents in favor of innovative ones. In this paper, we explore how avoidance biases like this influence the long-term evolution of linguistic constituents. We do so by means of evolutionary analysis of population dynamic models of linguistic diffusion. We show that if individuals are sufficiently sensitive with respect to variation then avoidance biases can yield linguistic diversification, i.e., stable coexistence of constituent variants.",

This observation suggests a common evolutionary pressure for a two digit system repertoire, one that existed before the origin of language, and present at the split with our evolutionary ancestors. We conducted a meta-analysis of the existing literature (143 articles) and discovered there is little in terms of comparative articulatory and acoustic analyses of great ape vocalizations. This is needed to shed light on the similarities between vocal communication systems and how each evolved in its own right over the last 6-7 million years of divergent evolution. And although we know that the size of great ape vocalic repertoires are similar across all extant great apes, there is still however much to learn about what we share vocally and gesturally, and how and when we diverged linguistically.",

The content of interest lacks a defined canonical representation across the textbooks (cf. out of 189 researchers, only 17 were cited in 5 or more textbooks). The coverage of animal communication was relatively broad. As its main problem we see overreliance on the outdated framework of \u201cdesign features\u201d (11 textbooks, 183 references), to the exclusion of other important frameworks such as signaling theory. In contrast, the coverage of topics related to language origins and evolution was much less extensive and systematic, and suffered from an overrepresentation of content of purely historical value (i.e. creation myths, \u201cbow-wow\u201d theories), at the expense of current research in this fast-paced field.",

        "summary": "Researchers have increasingly focused on the commonalities between animal communication and language with the aim to identify what makes language unique and to shed light on how it evolved. One area of recent study is whether linguistic laws also characterize vocal communication in other animals. Given their relevance for the evolution of language, here we provide a comprehensive review of the presence or absence of linguistic laws reported in studies on primate vocal communication. We find that primate vocal production follows Menzerath's law, while adherence to the other laws is mixed. Moreover, we raise three important points to consider when studying linguistic laws: the role of sexual dimorphism in vocal production, the criteria used to define a vocal sequence, and the choice of vocal units for analysis. Thus, this review provides a road map for future studies investigating linguistic laws in primates and is aimed at making results more comparable across species and signals.",

Wray and Grace argue that even compositionality may have only evolved in response to changing social contexts. But how does the referential context of local interactions come to shape the language of an entire community, and in what conditions does it favour the emergence of compositionality? To explore these questions, we propose an iterated hierarchical Bayesian model that provides a context-sensitive pathway for partner-specific linguistic innovations to be generalized as community-wide features. We show that the degree of compositionality that evolves in the language of a community is dependent on the communicative needs of its members, but also on the degree of uncertainty over the nature of those needs, and on whether the community's needs as a whole are heterogeneous.",

Thus, assessing the propensity for animals to combine calls provides important comparative insights on the evolutionary progression of our own combinatorial communication system. While emerging data has highlighted a latent ability of animals to combine calls into larger structures, it has been argued that two-call units represent the limit of animal combinatorics. Here, we revisit this subject through borrowing methods from computational linguistics to investigate the sequential dynamics in the call system of common marmosets (Callithrix Jacchus). We show that common marmosets reliably concatenate vocalisations into larger structures and further identify potential internal structuring to organise these call units (i.e., non-adjacency and nestedness). This leads to the conclusion that there might be more to the combinatorial sytsems of animals than previously thought.",

I do not propose a particular order in which the elements of modern language appear at this time. Rather, I focus on identifying the givens and the degrees of freedom currently available to such a model and I treat unknowns (like order of appearance of features) as algebraic variables. I then consider the skeletal model against the theoretical backdrop of Dual Inheritance Theory (DIT), which offers a robust account of the evolution of complex social behaviors in hominins. Extrapolating the model into the present offers new insight into what empirical data most depends on the unknown ordering: although the facts of language acquisition no longer qualitatively resemble their evolutionary history, they exhibit nested dependencies that do.",

        "summary": "Onomatopoeia is the use of words that imitate the sounds associated with the objects or actions they refer to. This study examines the origin and context of onomatopoeia and determines its significance in linguistic development from the comparative perspectives. The Japanese language has a wide range of onomatopoeic expressions to convey subtle information that cannot be expressed in normal words. We conducted observations by focusing on the emergence of onomatopoeias in the social interactions involving children in Japanese culture. The children used a rich repertoire of onomatopoeias to communicate about their internal images accompanied by gestures or bodily actions. Onomatopoeias may bridge the babbling in infancy and symbolic word utterance in early childhood, thus, have a scaffolding effect on the linguistic development. Since onomatopoeias connect simple vocalizations/gestures to the linguistic abilities in humans, more observations in early childhood will highlight the evolutional continuity with gestural communications observed in nonhuman primates.",

        "summary": "Speech is a fundamental component in language emergence, and is achieved through the human ability to voluntarily control vocalization. Vocalization is the output of sound produced from the coordinated movement of the vocal organs (e.g., lungs, larynx, tongue, mandible and mouth). Considering that the mechanisms that execute the movements seen during breathing and facial expression partially overlap with vocal movements, vocal movements should not be independent of other body movements, but rather should be observed in strong coupling with whole body movements. However, the details of the relationships underlying the motor control between vocal production and other body movements is still not fully understood due to the lack of observations based on experimental methods especially in nonhuman animals. Here we examined whether and to what extent vocalization and body movements are coupled when vocalization is induced by vocal training or produced spontaneously. We found that the characteristic head movement preceding the vocalization only occurs during the evoked vocalization, suggesting that proficiency in whole body movement might be an necessary process for learning in vocal control.",

        "summary": "One exciting but often puzzling aspect of the field of Language Evolution is the variety of sometimes theories and approaches it includes, some with contradictory assumptions or pursuing different questions. It has been argued before that this variety partly arises from different theories of language. I argue that another important factor underlying disparate, sometimes incommensurate approaches are different understandings and definitions of 'evolution', including 'what counts as evolution' and 'what evolution can explain'. I therefore suggest that greater attention to discussions about evolution in the philosophy of biology may help untangle and clarify differences and similarities between approaches and foster constructive discussions between approaches in the field of Language Evolution, and I propose assuming an 'generalized evolutionary ontology' that can encompass both biological and cultural (including linguistic) systems as 'evolution' may solve some incommensurabilities between approaches to language evolution.",

        "summary": "Music and language are prominent forms of acoustic communication across human societies. We are interested in understanding how speech and song differ, and whether these differences are shared across cultures. Many studies have documented acoustic differences between them, but few studies have identified consistent cross-cultural similarities or differences across a diverse set of languages. Therefore, we conducted comparative analyses with diverse cross-linguistic samples to explore more general acoustic properties. We observed potential systematic similarities and differences between song and speech, such as higher F0, longer inter-onset interval and stronger isochronous tendency in song, and similar ranges of intervals for both. But whether singing has greater pitch stability was language-dependent. Preliminary findings may support evolutionary theories of language and musicality such as the social bonding hypothesis and motor constraint hypothesis, but  larger, more diverse samples will be needed to evaluate their  implications and robustness.",

        "summary": "Various cooperative behaviors have been reported in nonhuman species including rats, however, it is unclear whether such behaviors are established based on each individual\u2019s coordination or independent contributions. We investigated whether rats show the joint Simon effect, which is used for testing action co-representation during a joint task in humans. We also compared whether a degree of the effect differed based on familiarity with the partner. Eight rats performed the auditory Simon and joint Simon tasks. Overall, they showed a higher error rate when the stimulus presentation position and the corresponding response were incompatible (Simon effects), therefore, they showed action co-representation for shared goals during the joint tasks. However, familiarity between partners only partially explain the differences in these effects. Further studies focusing on individual differences in the joint Simon effect, such as the frequency of paying attention to the partner, would be informative.",

        "summary": "Humans are known for their distinctive ability to find patterns and rules, which is so peculiar that they can even learn rules that are only assumed to exist but actually do not. Even more unique is their extraordinary inclination to obey the rules they find. This study explores the rule-obsessed nature of human beings under the concept of Homo regularis, man of rules, and tries to describe the nature of human language as what Homo regularis evolved to have. The ``language of Homo regularis'' view, the LHR view for short, has three components: 1) the process of rule generation, as opposed to rule learning, as the basic mechanism of language acquisition especially  concerning grammatical rules; 2) abduction, rather than induction, as the strategy or heuristics of rule generation; 3) analogy, instead of Merge, as the computational engine of rule generation.",

        "summary": "Recent natural language processing technologies are based on the vector space models of language, in which each word is represented with a vector in high dimensional space. One of the earliest successes using the vector space models is the four-term analogical reasoning task. A certain quadruple of word vectors forms a parallelogram in the vector space, with which the fourth word vector is inferred as an answer to a given triplet of query words. Despite the large body of successful application of the vector space models, it has remained unknown what the parallelogram means. This study aims to reveal this mystery. Our analysis suggested that analogical reasoning is possible by decomposition of the bigram co-occurrence matrix, and we demonstrated the formation of a parallelepiped by creating a miniature corpus and its word vectors.  This analysis and demonstration imply a sort of symmetry or exchangeability in word-word co-occurrence structure.",

        "summary": "The evolution of culture is shaped by two primary forces of directional change: biased transmission, which is similar to natural selection, and biased reconstruction, which is similar to non-random recurrent mutation. This paper presents an analytical solution to the combined effects of selection and biased mutation when each are formalized as stochastic processes (e.g. Griffiths & Kalish, 2007) with the goal of resolving debates over the relative strength of each force in cultural evolution. When evolutionary forces are combined, the system\u2019s dynamics can also be affected by the order in which the forces operate. We show how this explains some conflicting results in the literature to date: models in which selection appears to be stronger allow selection to operate last in the generational structure (e.g. Henrich & Boyd, 2002) and models in which biased mutation appears to be stronger allow mutation to operate last (e.g. Griffiths, Kalish, & Lewandowsky, 2008).",

Does one need to be able to hear sound to detect sound symbolism? Here, we show that one does not need to.  Deaf-and-Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) participants, even those with profound hearing loss, could judge the sound symbolic match between shapes and words just as well as hearing participants do, as long as DHH participants could move their tongue freely.  This indicates that people can detect sound symbolism via inherent resemblance between articulatory movements and the meanings.  This further suggests that linguistic symbols can emerge through iconic mapping between oral gesture and sensory experience of the world.",

There are various types of note orders in their song phrases. When the animals sing songs by combining acoustic elements flexibly, a complicated syntax may emerge. When phrase \u201cN\u201d is inserted within another phrase \u201cAB\u201d, the generated phrase is shown as \u201cANB\u201d. We named this structure a phrase-inserting structure. We hypothesized that there is a phrase-inserting structure in male Northern Gray gibbon songs. We analyzed 70 songs by a single male and found note orders that suggested a phrase-inserting structure. Phrase-inserting structure might be considered a sort of precursory level to phrase-embedding structure. Our results show that male Northern Gray gibbons are able to produce inserting sequences.",

        "summary": "The origin of language of one of the oldest question in science.  Our study informs vocal-first and gesture-first theories of language origin.  Experimental semiotic studies have shown that communication success is substantially higher for gesture than for (non-linguistic) vocalization.  Gesture\u2019s success may be explained by its affordance for signal embodiment (e.g., communicating the word \u2018drink\u2019 via manually simulating raising a container to one\u2019s mouth).  By contrast, the opportunity for signal embodiment is absent in the vocal modality.  Re-analysing data collected by Fay et al (2022), we test this question.  As predicted by an embodied account, in the gesture modality verbs were communicated more successfully than nouns and nouns were communicated more successfully than adjectives.   No such pattern was evident in vocal modality.  Our findings indicate that signal embodiment is important to gesture\u2019s communication success.",

        "summary": "In most languages, syllable production rate ranges from 2 to 8 syllables per second, hereafter theta production rhythm. Recent studies that highlighted the presence of the same rhythm in non-human primates suggest that it may be inherited from mastication. However, besides mastication, alternative factors could also explain vocal rhythm, such as environmental constraints, breathing, heart rate, or the recipient\u2019s neuronal activity. To determine what factor(s) may have contributed to the emergence of the theta vocal rhythm we collected data on vocalization rhythms for at least one species per infraorder of the tetrapods.  We used phylogenetic regression to assess whether weight (as a proxy of breathing/heart rate), mastication status or environmental constraints explain the variation in animal production rhythms. We observed that theta production rhythm is maintained across species, independently of their physical characteristic, mastication status or environment, pointing towards a more common and endogenous constrain for vocalization rhythm.",

        "summary": "The grammatical structure found in human language may have emerged through communication and cultural transmission. To focus on the role of communication in the evolution of word order rules, we designed an iterated learning experiment in which participants use a given set of words. The results of the experiment showed that communication facilitates the cultural evolution of word order rules. In cultural transmission chains with communication, the structural language with word order rules emerged rapidly and remained stable throughout the generations. On the other hand, in the cultural transmission chain without communication, the evolution of word order rules was very slow, and the word order distribution didn't show stability. These findings suggest that word order rules culturally evolve by sharing the intention to communicate.",

Previous research on rate variation across domains is unclear. Greenhill et al. (2017) and Carling and Cathcart (2021) show that lexical items (i.e., basic vocabulary) and morphological features tend to evolve faster than grammatical features at least in Austronesian and Indo-European, whereas Dediu and Cysouw (2013) show that syntactic features including word orders are more stable than morphological features, or there is no much rate difference across domains (Greenhill, Atkinson, Meade, & Gray, 2010). Newly available Uralic typological data allows us to estimate the rates of change across typological domains (Norvik et al., 2022) and understand the evolutionary dynamics of the Uralic language system.",

We found that the dependency length of English text is drastically shorter when words were replaced with their grammatical categories and purely syntactic dependency was considered, which suggests that the long dependency in human language is largely attributed to semantic factors. We also performed clustering in word-embedding spaces and showed that a larger number of clusters led to longer context dependency. We also found that larger vocabularies instead shortened dependency length in Bengalese finch song while moderate vocabulary sizes amounted to comparable dependency lengths to English syntax. We also showed that English phoneme sequences have a much shorter dependency length, casting doubt on the previous generalization in comparative studies that birdsong is more homologous to human language phonology than to syntax.",

Network structures vary from all individuals interacting within group (i.e. highly assortative) to individuals interacting randomly (i.e. random mixing). British Sign Language (BSL) exhibits a high degree of lexical variability across the population (i.e. globally), while within each region (i.e. locally) it exhibits a relatively low degree of lexical variability. In contrast, it has been found that Kata Kolok, a sign language with a dense social network exhibits a lower degree of lexical variability than BSL, but likely due to frequent population-wide interaction, it exhibits a higher degree of variation than any single region in BSL. Using an agent based model, we find that network structure is a candidate in explaining the difference in lexical variability locally and globally, where within group interaction exhibits lower levels of lexical variability compared across the population as a whole.",

        "summary": "I documented four types of sound production behaviors by cockatiels, which were similar to music production by humans. (1) the cockatiels imitated a melody of human music. (2) the cockatiels sang the song in synchrony with playback of the melody. (3) the birds spontaneously arranged the melody. (4) they created novel rhythmic sound sequences which totally differed from the melody. I did not train them with any specific methods. The birds showed these behaviors spontaneously and I did not give any food reinforcement for the behavior. The results suggest that the cockatiels and humans share some capabilities necessary for music production. Studies of cockatiels and other parrot species can become a key to discuss some critical components necessary for music and language evolution.",

The neural implementation of Merge is not well understood (Rizzi 2012, Zaccarella et al 2017), but must involve something functionally equivalent to pointers in working memory. Every Merge requires two pointers, and full syntactic trees may require dozens. Other syntactic paradigms also need pointers.\r\nHumans do hierarchies in general better than chimpanzees. Any hierarchical thinking requires nested pointers in working memory, but they are neurologically expensive and degrade with depth (Crawford et al. 2016). Humans have larger working-memory capacity than chimpanzees, which has been proposed as key to human cognitive evolution (Read 2008, Coolidge & Wynn, 2005). Gradual evolutionary growth of pointer capacity will allow gradually increasing syntactic complexity, without saltations in the underlying computational machinery. Both depth degradation and pointer capacity naturally limit Merge even in modern humans, consistent with corpus data (e.g. Karlsson 2010).",

        "summary": "Speaking is a complex behavior at the intersection between cognitive and motor processes that implies the coordination of multiple systems and of multiple vocal-tract muscles. The oromotor structures in charge of articulating speech are not only responsible of the production of speech targets, such as phonemes, syllables or words, but they also produce other sounded non-speech orofacial movements. The brain processes underlying the production of speech and non-speech oromotor behaviors have been shown to differ in young adults but it is uncertain when exactly in ontogeny the production of speech differs from that of non-speech gestures. In the present study we explore this question, with the main hypothesis of a specialized motor control system for speech arising only after some years of full practice of speech, in middle childhood.",

The main aim of this theory-based proposal is to present an alternative scenario in which language grammar might have originated from primary \u2018felt\u2019 sound relations used to induce emotions rather than from articulate symbols designed to exchange cognitive concepts alone. From this perspective, the mechanisms that enabled proto-musical forms of rhythm and pitch hierarchies could have been exapted to serve a hierarchical framework for sound (and gestural) symbols in order to enable the exchange of information about the increasing social complexity. As a result, this exaptation could have led to the emergence of language grammar and a complex conceptual mind.",

        "summary": "Humans exhibit unusual vocal behaviour when interacting with children. In this \u2018child-directed speech\u2019 (CDS) the speech signal changes, both acoustically and structurally. The main features of CDS are increased conspicuousness and comprehensibility compared to adult-directed speech, supporting a functional teaching role. Here, we investigate whether CDS evolved to accelerate language acquisition, by comparing it with infant-directed communication in great apes and other animals. We find that great-apes rarely direct vocal behaviour at their infants, and if so in ways indistinguishable from adult-directed communication. In other, more distantly related animals, some species engaging in vocal learning also direct vocalisations specifically at infants. Given that communicative competence in great-apes appears to be fine-tuned more by surrounding vocalisations, child-surrounding speech in humans requires much more attention. We conclude that, even though CDS does indeed serve to facilitate language acquisition, it also remains plausible that child-surrounding speech can compensate for a lack of CDS.",

We found that route descriptions differed between conditions and that differences were enhanced over generations. This suggest that participants are susceptible to the visuo-spatial affordances on their local environment when preparing their instructions, and that these environmental biases are enhanced through social transmission pointing to the way language guide attention and conceptualization of space.",

Recent work found that species can escape acoustic allometry through anatomical adaptations to their vocal tracts or through vocal learning. Testing whether vocal tract size scales with body size offers a simple way of identifying which mechanism is used. Our study measured the vocal tracts of 68 young harbor seals and tested for allometry with body size. We find that the vocal tracts of harbor seals scale with their body size. Thus, by exclusion, this species uses vocal learning to escape acoustic allometry. Future anatomical studies can identify new species capable of vocal learning, a prerequisite for human speech. Adopting a comparative approach using many vocal learners could offer promising insights into the biological underpinnings of communication systems such as spoken language.",

Surprisingly, relatively little is known about the evolution of repair and possible precursors in non-linguistic species. However, in 1996 Dunbar suggested that early humans may have engaged in complex grooming interactions before grooming was replaced with the more efficient bonding system of language. Here, we thus tested whether grooming is a useful platform to study repair and investigated grooming interactions of one of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). We propose a four-aspect framework that can offer a systematic cross-comparison of communicative repair in primates within the grooming context.",

Signers, for example, use pointing signs towards arbitrary locations in space to refer to different agents. However, not all sign languages use spatial strategies for non-spatial relations. To date, it is not fully understood why there are such typological differences.\r\n\r\nWe investigate to what degree these typological differences can be explained by differences in the surrounding co-speech gesture systems of sign languages. To test this, we conduct a silent gesture experiment in two different cultural settings: Bali and the Netherlands. The Balinese co-speech gesture system is different from most Western ones, as it uses a geocentric instead of an egocentric pointing system. If the ambient co-speech gesture system is relevant to the development of spatial referential strategies, we should see this reflected in the strategies developed by the two test groups.",

I created a computer model of language that implements Free Merge, and I explain how two properties of language, the need for syntactic structures to be labeled (Labeling), and constraints regarding theta assignment (the theta-criterion) can constrain Free Merge.

In the previous adversarial imitation learning, the generated patterns become only chaotic but not structured. Therefore, we extend the previous model using the idea of generative adversarial networks (GANs) used in deep learning. The agents are modeled with the generator and discriminator networks. Our results show that the mutual adversarial imitation learning can lead to the higher fractal dimensions of the generated patterns and causes the structurization of patterns.",

        "summary": "Although sound symbolic effects of \u2018bouba-kiki\u2019 type have been reported across cultures (\u0106wiek et al., 2022), it remains unclear whether this effect is an ability unique to humans. Sound symbolic effects between speech sounds and shapes (K\u00f6hler, 1919) might have played an important role in shaping protolanguages. Humans could have understood that certain speech sounds can evoke certain sensory properties. This ability could have plausibly assisted referential insight in our human ancestors (Perniss and Vigliocco, 2014). The discussion on the role of sound symbolism in shaping human languages gives rise to the following question: \u201cCan nonhuman great apes detect congruencies between \u2018round\u2019 and \u2018sharp\u2019 nonwords and curved and sharp shapes?\u201d . Previous research has shown that a group of touchscreen trained chimpanzees (N=6) and gorillas (N=2), when tested with a two-alternative forced choice task on sound-shape mappings showed no sound symbolic effects (Margiotoudi et al., 2019). Specifically, both gorillas and chimpanzees failed to detect that a \u2018round\u2019 nonword, such as \u201cbouba\u201d, is a good fit to a curved shape and a \u2018sharp\u2019 nonword, such as \u201ckiki\u201d, is a good fit to a spiky shape. In parallel, humans were tested with the same task and showed a significant sound symbolic congruency. In both tasks, neither the nonhuman nor the human great apes were explicitly instructed to detect congruencies between nonwords and shapes. Notably, when a second group of human participants were explicitly instructed to detect sound symbolic congruencies in the same task, they showed above chance performance and detected congruencies 10% more often compared to the previous implicit task. Conclusively, when humans are explicitly instructed to detect sound symbolic congruencies, they achieve a better performance. However, humans are exposed to speech stimuli compared to nonhuman great apes and have referential insight. Could a nonhuman great ape exposed to speech stimuli detect speech sound-shape consistencies? In a different study, a language competent bonobo was tested with a match-to-sample task on the \u2018bouba-kiki\u2019 effect. The bonobo has been able to match English words to pictures with the same task. Hence, he tries to pick the best match from different stimuli. Using his strategy, a second study investigated whether a nonhuman great ape being exposed to speech stimuli would be able to detect sound symbolic congruencies under an explicit match-to-sample task. Specifically, the bonobo performed his familiar match English words to pictures task, while sound symbolic trials of \u201cbouba-kiki\u201d type were interspersed. This kind of paradigm allowed testing a nonhuman primate under explicit instructions. The bonobo tried to guess the best matching shape for the \u2018round\u2019 and \u2018sharp\u2019 nonwords as he did for the English word-picture matching. The results of the study revealed no sound symbolic congruency detection but significantly above chance performance in matching English words to pictures (Margiotoudi et al., 2022). \nThese findings suggest that the \u2018bouba-kiki\u2019 mapping is plausibly an ability unique to humans. These results  might be explained by neurobiological differences found between human and nonhuman great apes that are relevant to the mechanism supporting the speech sounds-shape mappings. We suggest that the mechanism of this effect is found in the knowledge of the multimodal products of our hand actions. This binding has special preconditions found at a neuronal level, with auditory-visual and motor systems linked in the brain via long white matter tracts.",

        "summary": "Previous studies have suggested that 50 kHz \u201cpleasant\u201d USV increases heart rate with a significant tendency, while 22 kHz \u201cunpleasant\u201d USV decreases heart rate. However, the environment in which laboratory rats are raised is quite different from the environment in which wild rats live. In this study, we examined whether the environmental richness affects the responsiveness to USV. Of the 12 weaned rats, 6 were kept in a standard laboratory environment and the other 6 were kept in an enriched environment for 2 months. The heart rate of each rat was then measured, during which 50 kHz and 22 kHz USV were presented. As a result, there was no significant change from baseline in any of the conditions. We would like to investigate whether the enrichment was appropriate through further experiments.",

We apply tools from evolutionary game theory to analyze the relationship between the degree of AOI and the evolutionary stability of potential signaling strategies. We show that there is an evolutionary benefit for adopting a communication strategy that is conditioned on social cues: hints about the interlocutor's attitude which gives rise to the degree of AOI in the given situation. We show that this kind of strategy i) is the only evolutionarily stable strategy in a scenario where social cues are accessible, ii) has very low underlying requirements (with respect to AOI) to be evolutionarily stable, and iii) is less reliable for the receiver, since it determines the sender to be partially dishonest.",

        "summary": "Why do humans constantly use gestures in addition to language? We tested a disambiguation account of the use of gesture with ambiguous Japanese relative clause structures consisting of a verb followed by two nouns, which can be either left branching (LB: the verb modifies the first noun) or right branching (RB: the verb modifies the second noun). We used a forced gesture task to investigate whether people produce different types of gestures to disambiguate the meanings of such structurally ambiguous phrases, and then coded the speech and gestures produced by the participants. The results show that for LB structures, the participants expressed iconic gestures on both N1 and N2 (sequentially or simultaneously). However, for RB structures, the participants expressed iconic gestures on either N1 or N2. This suggests that people spontaneously chunk the production of gestures to encode information that can disambiguate ambiguous phrases, supporting the disambiguation account.",

The stimuli were preselected by means of a lexical decision task. Altogether 110 adult participants took part in this experiment. \r\nThe task of the subjects was to identify the word and choose the appropriate picture from the two proposed. EEG was recorded using Mitsar electroencephalograph (bandwidth, 0.5\u201370 Hz) with a 250Hz sampling rate for each channel. \r\nIt was found that there was no statistically significant difference between visually presented explicit-SI, implicit-SI words, and non-SI words. However, statistically significant differences were obtained for audibly presented explicit SI words in contrast to implicit SI-words and non-SI words at P300 endogenous evoked potential which reflects cognitive processes, such as attention and stimulus categorization.",

We played back conspecific vocalizations to 18 harbor seal pups (Phoca vitulina), some hearing only 2 distinct calls whereas others heard 30 calls from different individuals. To analyze how the playbacks affected the pups\u2019 vocal development, we employed machine learning techniques, learning how to distinguish between vocalizations based on the provided acoustic input features. Once trained, their classification accuracy provides a measure of how distinct two groups of vocalizations are. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning for the analysis of complex acoustic data. Moreover, they also highlight the importance of auditory input on the vocal development in harbor seals, analogous to what has been found in other vocal learning species.",

Language is such a system, but existing models that link properties of a population to properties of language do not take hysteresis into account explicitly. This paper proposes a very basic and abstract model, based on statistical physics and maximum entropy, that has hysteresis. The model has two parameters, one of which is related to the mean value of the linguistic property in the population, and the other appears to represent that there exist different strategies (e.g. iconic versus conventional communication) to achieve the goal of language (e.g. communication, learnability) and that a language needs to compromise between these.",

        "summary": "To enable vocal learning in songbirds, integration between the auditory and motor representations of the vocalizations must be established in the brain. Recent electrophysiological studies revealed that HVC neurons projecting to the part of the avian basal ganglia (AreaX) important for song learning are activated both when birds sing and when they listen their own songs. Here we attempt to identify neurons activated both during singing and listening in the whole brain using a molecular biological approach. We investigated the expression of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) in several conditions, because its subcellular localization permits analysis of two experiences separated in time within the same brain cells. Neurons expressing Arc in both cytoplasm and nucleus can be determined as song-related auditory-motor neurons, or mirror neurons. We found such neurons in HVC and in AreaX. These results suggest that the integration of auditory and motor representations occur in the basal ganglia.",

        "summary": "Motivation to vocalize is important to maintain and improve human language, and should be rewarded by internal mechanism. As they are vocal-learners, investigating what mechanism motivates to vocalize learned song in male songbirds would help to understand language enhancement and evolution. Area X, basal ganglia in songbird receives premotor and dopaminergic input, and is an important candidate in which its neural activity reflects motivation of vocalization. In order to investigate motivation in learned vocalization, present study recorded neural activity in Area X of male Java sparrow (Lonchura oryzivora), a species of songbird, and compared change in firing rate before initiating learned and innate vocalization. Results revealed that neural activity in Area X shows longer preparatory activity before vocalizing learned vocalization than innate. It suggested that may cause longer change in internal state, and motivate activity increase in various area, which may enables individuals complex and skilled vocalization.",

        "summary": "Cortico-basal ganglia circuitry is crucial for vocal learning in a songbird. Neurons in the premotor cortical nucleus (HVC), that project to a part of the basal ganglia (Area X), fire both when a bird is singing and when it is listening to the bird\u2019s own song (BOS). These \u201caudio-vocal mirror neurons\u201d may have important roles to integrate auditory and vocal-motor information. We examined whether there are audio-vocal mirror neurons in Area X. We found two types of mirror neurons. One type fired at the specific syllable timing and classified as putative medium spiny neuron (MSN). The other type was active when a bird was singing and when it was listening to BOS during sleep. These neurons were classified as internal globus pallidus (GPi) neurons. These results suggest that MSN receive both auditory and vocal-motor information from HVC and that GPi send such information to thalamic nucleus necessary for vocal learning.",

Agents in a two-dimensional social space get together or away from each other according to the similarity between their utterances, generated from their genetic and cultural traits (lists of nouns representing innate and cultural preferences to the topic) using a pre-trained model of Japanese sentence generation based on GPT-2, and receive nouns as cultural traits from their neighbors\u2019 utterances. The experiments showed that agents were actively moving and exchanging novel traits with neighbors and the emergence and collapse of chatting clusters happened repeatedly. The agents initially uttered words related to Japanese literature due to their innate preference, which were taken over by more various words, and further trends of Japanese literature emerged. These indicate the framework enables us to discuss the cultural evolution of novel traits based on social dynamics.",

While the diachronic development of grammatical gender systems is well studied, noun class systems have received less attention. We use phylogenetic comparative methods to analyze where noun classes are marked (on nouns, pronouns, demonstratives, articles, adjectives, numbers, and verbs) in Atlantic languages (n = 36) and how these markers change diachronically. Our results show that noun class marking is generally preferred and more stable within the noun phrase, i.e., on nouns, demonstratives, and adjectives.",

Using novel phylogenetic methods, we assess the impact of frequency and alternation patterns on properties of their evolution, specifically on the speed of change and the long term preference for pattern types within lemmata. We find credible differences in long-term trends between alternation patterns, and confirm the notion that frequency drives the maintenance of irregular patterns. However, our model reveals no or only weak effects of either predictor on the speed of change. Our findings call for modeling the multiple dimensions of language change jointly but with distinct parameters for speed (or rates) of change and long-term preferences.",

We apply agent-based models, using real-world data, to study if, and through what mechanisms, adult language contact could lead to morphological simplification. We use data from Alorese, a language in Eastern Indonesia which has possibly simplified due to adult language contact. In our model, a population of agents play a language game, in which they try to communicate concepts (verb+person) using inflected verb forms. We evaluate two cognitive mechanisms that we think could give rise to morphological simplification: the procedural-declarative model of L1/L2 language processing and reduction of word forms based on language-specific prosody. Based on our results, it appears that the procedural-declarative model, based on generalization, may be an important mechanism in explaining the relation between language contact and simplification.",

        "summary": "Pitch is the psychological representation of tone height. Octave similarity, in which octave-related sounds sound similar, is the basis for the mechanism of pitch perception. To investigate the principle and biological origin of octave similarity, we aim to test octave similarity in rats and conducted a behavioral experiment using operant conditioning. Five rats were trained to form lever-pressing behaviors, and discrimination training and probe tests were conducted using sound stimuli. As a result, all rats perceived the probe sound as different from the training sound and responded to it without octave similarity. The analysis suggested that the deflection of the response may have been caused by the comparison of the relative pitch of the presented sound stimuli. From now on, we will adjust the experimental method to eliminate response cues other than the presented sounds and further verify the phenomenon of pitch perception.",

        "summary": "The ability to refer to one's own internal state, also known as metacognition, is one of the minimum requirements for enabling complex thoughts and communication using language. The results of comparative psychology over the past three decades suggest that non-human animals without language refer to their own internal states and use them to control their behavior. These findings suggest that this ability evolved prior to language by its own function. However, it is difficult to reveal from animal experiments how animals evolved this ability. Therefore, we explored the conditions where behavioral control based on internal states can be acquired through evolution by computational simulations. The results suggest that this ability evolves in response to insufficiency of feedback from the external environment. Our simulations will contribute to propose a plausible evolutionary scenario for how cognitive basis for language have been prepared before humans.",

Through which\uff0c we suggest that categorical perception has a phylogenetic root and is a combination of nature and nurture. Further, based on the neurological basis that connection between auditory cortex and (pre)motor cortex, and between (pre)motor cortex and the basal ganglia, we hypothesize that categorical perception (CP) could have paved the way for discreteness across domains including language.",

Agents in our model use reinforcement learning, where probabilities of selection of a communicated word or of its interpretation depend on weights equal to the number of accumulated successful communications. When the probabilities increase linearly with weights, synonyms appear to be very stable and homonyms decline relatively fast. Such behaviour seems to be at odds with linguistic observations. A better agreement is obtained when  probabilities increase faster than linearly with weights.  Our results may suggest that a certain positive feedback, the so-called Metcalfe's Law,  possibly drives some linguistic processes.",

However, it has been argued that the design feature approach does not pay enough attention to the actual cognitive capacities underlying these features and the ecological and social settings in which they are used. Here we argue that if linguistics wants to continue using Hockett\u2019s design features, this needs to be complemented by a decompositional approach that explicates a given design feature with regard to the cognitive and neuroscientific component parts that underlie the feature. Here, we illustrate this approach by focussing on the property of displacement, with implications for an overall re-evaluation of Hockett\u2019s design features. Cognitively, displacement is linked to episodic memory, and from a neuroscientific perspective, it depends on neural structures like the hippocampus.",

        "summary": "Language is not disconnected from its wider environment, and exposure to different environmental contexts might partly explain the great diversity of the world's languages. For instance, exposure to UV light impacts eye physiology, slightly reducing the ability to perceive blue colours. In turn, this may partially explain why many languages do not distinguish \"green\" and \"blue\" but use a single-colour term encompassing both. Here, we investigate the relationship between colour perception and UV incidence in the Himba community, a non-WEIRD population of northern Namibia exposed to high rates of UV light, and compare them with French participants. We found that the capacity to discriminate between close colours is generally lower for Himba participants and decreases with age in both groups. Although preliminary, these results suggest that biases in colour perception induced by the environment might influence colour lexicon, highlighting the importance of considering a multi-factorial landscape in understanding language evolution.",

In this study we explore the development of some of these variables over time, taking as a case study nominal plurality on a sample of 56 Sino-Tibetan languages. The variables under examination include phonological and morphosyntactic features of cohesion of the plural markers to the respective stem(s). We use phylogenetic methods to explore whether there is a preference over time for each integration parameter, and we model the diachronic change of each integration feature over the Sino-Tibetan phylogeny independently according to a continuous-time Markov process for binary data. We find that integration features involving the linear order of elements are highly preferred, while others are not.",

        "summary": "The rhythm of spoken language is important for language perception and acquisition. It has also been linked to rhythm in music and the communication systems in other animal species, thus providing valuable cues to the evolutional emergence of spoken language. However, because acoustic measures have failed to find isochrony in the linguistic signal, it remains unknown whether listeners can indeed perceive linguistic units of varying length as rhythmic. Here we, therefore, test whether natural recordings from two syllable-timed languages (Italian and French) and two stress-timed languages (Dutch and Polish) elicit rhythm perception by measuring German-speaking adults\u2019 pupil size. We show that changes in pupil size synchronize better to syllable rhythm in syllable-timed and to stress rhythm in stress-timed languages. Pupillary entrainment may therefore provide a measure for the psychological reality of speech rhythm under conditions of naturally occurring variability",

        "summary": "When interlocutors repeatedly describe referents to each other, they rapidly converge on referring expressions which become increasingly systematized and abstract as the interaction progresses. Previous research suggests that repair mechanisms in dialogue underpin convergence. However this research has so far only focused on the role of other-initiated repair and has not examined whether self-initiated repair might also play a role. To investigate this question we report the results from a maze task experiment: Participants communicate via an experimental chat-tool, which selectively transforms participants\u2019 private turn-revisions into public self-repairs that are made visible to the other participant. Participants who received these self-repairs used more abstract referring expressions, but performed worse at the task. We argue this is due to self-repair causing participants to put more effort into diagnosing and resolving referential coordination problems they face in the task, yielding better grounded spatial semantics and consequently increased use of abstract referring expressions.",

        "summary": "Previous work suggests that linguistic features which are difficult for L2 learners to acquire are prone to being lost in situations of language contact. We present a mathematical model of such contact dynamics involving a mixed population of L1 and L2 speakers, building on the variational learning model of acquisition and change. The system exhibits two phases separated by a bifurcation: a phase in which the L2-difficult grammar continues to exist in both the L1 and L2 speaker groups, and another phase in which it is lost from both populations. This second phase is entered if the fraction of L2 speakers is large enough in relation to the magnitude of L2-difficulty and the fitness differential of the competing grammars. We estimate these parameters for two historical changes, morphological simplification in Afrikaans and the loss of null subjects in Afro-Peruvian Spanish; the model correctly predicts the qualitative shape of both developments.",

        "summary": "The availability of large databases has revolutionized linguistic typology and language evolution, but such databases are too often taken at face value. In particular, phonological databases, based on phonemic inventories, are usually interpreted as reflecting the phonetic reality of languages, but they mask and distort the existing variation. As an example, Winter et al. (2022) have recently suggested that roughness is associated with trilled /r/ cross-linguistically, but when looking at a subset of their data more closely, we noticed that the authors' choices in considering that languages having or not a trill in their inventory does not seem justified in almost 50% of the cases. Our contribution highlights the dangers of assuming phonetic meaning from written symbols allegedly representing phonological systems when conducting large-scale cross-linguistic studies.",

We assumed that pantomime is suitable for simple narratives, where events are arranged in a chronological sequence, rather than more complex narratives, where events are in a non-chronological order. This assumption was put to test in a study based on \"semiotic games\". Participants took turns as directors and matchers, playing four games, in which they mimed and guessed stories in two conditions: chronological and non-chronological. We found that non-chronological representations had lower communicative success than chronological ones and that differences in communicative success between the conditions and the games were significant. A possible explanation of this result is that some participants managed to indicate a disruption of chronology by means of specific movements, subject to conventionalisation. We discuss these findings in the context of the bodily mimesis theory and the evolutionary trajectory of pantomime and narrative.",

They play a key role in joint action coordination by showing positive evidence of understanding and scaffolding narrative delivery. Here we investigate the hypothesis that their functional importance along with their  conversational ecology places selective pressures on their form and may lead to cross-linguistic similarities through convergent cultural evolution. We compare continuer tokens in linguistically diverse conversational corpora and find languages make available highly similar forms. We then approach the causal mechanism of convergent cultural evolution using exemplar modelling, simulating the process by which a combination of effort minimization and functional specialization may push continuers to a particular region of phonological possibility space. By combining comparative linguistics and computational modelling we shed new light on the question of how language structure is shaped by and for social interaction.",

        "summary": "When people interact with each other they rapidly develop idiosyncratic referring expressions and associated meanings with their partner. In addition to natural language, interaction is underpinned by myriad non-verbal signals which are used, inter-alia, to regulate turn-taking. However, it is currently unclear whether such turn-taking signals are static and fixed, or whether, like natural language, they can be negotiated by participants during interaction. To address this question triads of participants play a task in virtual reality which is inspired by games such as guitar hero and dance-dance revolution: Instead of co-ordinating on musical notes, the participants have to co-ordinate their gaze behaviour, which requires that participants bootstrap a communication system, solely using their gaze patterns. The results show that  participants rapidly establish  routines for coordinating the timing and sequencing of their gaze patterns. This suggests that the turn-taking function of eye-gaze is flexibly negotiated by interlocutors during interaction",

        "summary": "Iconicity is prevalent in early communication, perhaps because it scaffolds word learning by helping to establish referentiality or because iconic words are more pronounceable for infants. This study asked whether another function of iconicity is increasing infants\u2019 engagement in interactions. Iconicity ratings were assigned to words in a mother\u2019s utterances in 41 interactions with her infant (aged 12-24 months). High and low iconicity bouts were identified by calculating the rolling average of iconicity per 5 words and focusing on utterances with the highest and lowest averages. Key features from 58 high and 58 low iconicity bouts were coded from corresponding video. High-iconicity interactions contained more behaviours indicative of engagement than low iconicity interactions. Our findings speak to the multi-functional nature of iconicity in parent-child interactions. They suggest iconic words might be prevalent in current vocabularies because people find these words to be intrinsically engaging.",

        "summary": "Agreement, a systematic formal mapping between linguistic elements, adds redundancy to languages (e.g., in \u2018she writes\u2019 the -s adds no information), and yet is crosslinguistically prevalent. Here, we explore the hypothesis that agreement may be functional by providing additional cues for language learning. We conducted an artificial language learning experiment to test whether agreement, and especially, alliterative agreement \u2013 where the agreement is expressed by repetition of the same form, can facilitate learning of noun classes. To this end, we compared the learnability of noun class systems in three input conditions: no agreement, alliterative agreement, and non-alliterative agreement. Results showed that while the alliterative agreement itself was learned better than the non-alliterative agreement, there was no difference between conditions in learning noun class systems. In follow-up work, we test the hypothesis that agreement is beneficial for child learners, rather than adult learners (Lupyan & Dale, 2010).",

We present a simulation study that demonstrates: (i) natural sentences are more uniform than random and asymmetric orders, (ii) more uniform distributions lose less information overall, and (iii) uniform distributions of information are 100% successful at preventing catastrophic information loss. We expand on the noise threshold and effects of clustered noise on linguistic structure, and present an information-theoretic model of linguistic signalling in which losses due to noise compound through layers of linguistic structure. This perspective predicts several features of information distribution in language, and particularly the need to prevent catastrophic information loss in the event of analogue noise.",

        "summary": "Communicative repair is a fundamental and universal element of interactive language use. It has been suggested that the persistence and elaboration after communicative breakdown in nonhuman primates constitute two evolutionary building blocks of this capacity, but the conditions favouring it are poorly understood. Because zoo-housed individuals of some species are more social and more terrestrial than in the wild, they should be more likely to show gestural redoings (i.e. both repetition and elaboration) after communicative failure in the coordination of their joint activities. Using a large comparative sample of wild and zoo-housed orang-utans of two different species, we could confirm this prediction for elaboration, the more flexible form of redoings. Specifically, results showed that gestural redoings in general were best predicted by the specific joint action context (i.e. social play) and interaction dyad (i.e. beyond mother-offspring), although were least frequent in captive Bornean orang-utans. For gestural elaboration, we found the expected differences between captive and wild research settings in Borneans, but not in Sumatrans (the more socially tolerant species). Moreover, we found that the effectiveness of elaboration in eliciting responses was higher in Sumatrans, especially the captive ones, whereas effectiveness of mere repetition was influenced by neither species nor setting. We conclude that the socio-ecological environment plays a central role in the emergence of communicative repair strategies in great apes.",

        "summary": "Research on the emergence and evolution of speech has often relied on primate models, as they share a broadly similar vocal apparatus and are considered to provide a window into ancestral states. However, many primates, such as chimpanzees, live in complex social systems in environments where visibility is low and they need to communicate over long distances. In these instances, the vocalisations produced involve high intensity signals associated with high fundamental frequencies (fo) that are well suited for long distance propagation. This also implies that these vocalisations cannot always provide complete formant information or contrast, as is the case for human vowels which are produced with low fundamental frequencies. Here we investigate the importance of fo modulation in the chimpanzee vocal repertoire in relation to full spectral information using supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches. The results are discussed from an evolutionary perspective and compared to human vocal productions.",

Key elements of speech acquisition include the ability of vocal production learning and babbling, a production milestone in infant speech development. We introduce a promising candidate for comparative research on vocal ontogenetic processes in mammalian vocal production learners: the bat Saccopteryx bilineata. During their ontogeny, pups exhibit a conspicuous vocal practice behavior with a strong similarity to infant babbling. We investigated the babbling behavior of 20 wild pups and compared its features to those characterizing human infant babbling. Our study demonstrates that bat pup babbling is characterized by the same eight features that define human infant babbling, including the features rhythmicity and reduplication. In conclusion, our study provides the first formal comparison of babbling features across vocal learning mammals and is the first step for future neurogenetic studies.",

        "summary": "Could the aesthetic appeal of linguistic features influence their learnability, and in turn their long-term stability during language change and evolution? Focusing on prosodic patterns, we investigated the baseline assumption that linguistic features like stress patterns affect aesthetic appeal. Listeners\u2019 ratings of isochronous words and words with initially, medially or finally lengthened or shortened syllables revealed that, indeed, different prosodic patterns differed in their aesthetic appeal in terms of \u2018liking\u2019, \u2018beauty\u2019 and \u2018naturalness\u2019. Furthermore, aesthetic ratings of these prosodic patterns corresponded to their effectiveness for speech segmentation in previous experiments, suggesting a potential connection between aesthetics and language processing. This research opens up new avenues for future research on the role of aesthetic preferences in language acquisition, change and evolution.",

        "summary": "Social interactions enhance vocal learning in songbirds, but underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. To understand this, we tested the hypothesis that direct listening to songs from a live tutor enhances midbrain dopaminergic activity as a social reward for juvenile birds, leading to accurate song memory formation. We recorded neural activity from midbrain dopaminergic system in freely behaving juvenile zebra finches, and examined whether auditory responses to the tutor songs changed depending on the presence or absence of a live tutor. We found that a subset of VTA/SNc neurons exhibited auditory responses to the tutor song presented from a speaker, and that these responses were markedly enhanced in the presence of a live tutor. We also found that local administration of dopamine in higher auditory cortex markedly enhanced auditory responses of auditory cortical neurons. These results suggest that dopamine is a key neuromodulator to enhance vocal learning in songbirds.",

        "summary": "Bringing together the archaeological record from art history and tool production, this paper delineates four different stages of semiotic and hence communicative abilities for hominin evolution from the primate stage to modern homo sapiens: (1) reactive-mimetic; (2) proactive-mimetic; (3) hyperindexical; and (4) externalized iconic and symbolic. These evolutionary stages presuppose a gradual emancipation of a virtual sphere detached from nature and a corresponding giving over of hominin evolution to culturally rather than genetically determined conditions. This transition comprises a spiraling turn in the Lower Paleolithic, in which the phylogenetic lifeworld emerges as an enlargement of the intimate space of postnatal ontogenesis, what we term a macro-cocoon. Although we hold that any hominin line would possibly follow this route of development, either independently or in interaction with other contemporary lines, only Homo Sapiens reached the fourth stage.",

Our close relatives, non-human primates, cannot learn to produce novel vocalizations, but a small group of other animals that are evolutionary further removed from us, such as bats, can. We used two complementary approaches, neuroimaging and neurogenetic mapping, to start to map the connectivity of the vocal learning Phyllostomus discolor bat brain and to highlight potential brain areas of interest for the study of vocal learning in P. discolor. We successfully acquired high-quality DTI data of post-mortem P. discolor brains. We also show that the expression of a set of marker genes for brain areas related to voluntary vocal control is not dispersed uniformly across the P. discolor cortex, but is enriched and reduced in specific layers and cortical areas.",

        "summary": "Over the last decade, language evolution research has been the driving force behind a renewed interest in non-arbitrary mappings, as well as multimodal theories of language. These theories have focused largely on lexical iconicity in language systems. Here, we begin to extend this line of research by considering how non-arbitrariness plays a role in language development and emergence beyond the lexicon, moving from lexical to pragmatic meaning across different modalities. In other words, we focus on non-arbitrariness in situated language scaffolding the development of questions. By surveying the state of the art in research on prosody, gesture, and signing, we outline evidence for cross-linguistically attested, iconic gestural scaffolding of questions across signed and spoken languages. This supports development of indexical use of pitch in question prosody, which has analogies in non-arbitrary dominance signaling. We conclude by synthesizing this evidence, presenting a novel non-arbitrary bootstrapping theory for the emergence of questions.",

To contribute to this trend, we created a comprehensive database of information on the Evolang conference series, as representative of the language evolution academic community. In what follows, we discuss the applicability of this database for scientometric research and present a case study of the academic profiles of those researchers involved in Evolang who self-identify with interests and disciplines most commonly associated with language evolution.",

We specifically investigate individuals' inferential policies when categorising unknown wordforms, and the impact of those policies on large-scale patterns of evolution in inflection systems across generations. We find that while stronger biases due to morphology-external correlations among lexemes generally enable agents to categorise them more consistently, the way those correlations are distributed in the grammar may actually impede reliable categorisation. Our model is publicly available and widely extensible, and we discuss several possible additions that could be made in order to investigate further features of inflection systems, cognitive policies and demographic organisation. We highlight further parameters of interest for future work aiming to more fully understand the complex cultural evolution of complex morphological systems.",

What evolved in our species is primarily the capacity for generating complex recursive thought, and then being able to represent those thoughts within the constraints of linear, phonetically grounded, symbolic systems.

        "summary": "Learning to communicate intentionally is an important milestone of early ontogeny. Pointing is one of the first entry points into this process, since gestures often precede verbal communication. During early development, and in later language use, pointing and linguistic utterances interact in many ways, complementing each other. However, little is known about the development of this relationship during language acquisition. Here we focus on the development of finger pointing and accompanying utterances in infants growing up in two different cultures: Russia and Chintang (Eastern Nepal). We show that despite the differences in environment, the development of finger pointing and accompanying language use show substantial similarities. Early on, a larger proportion of points is not accompanied by language. As the children's linguistic abilities develop, children first use language to specify what is being pointed at, and later elaborate on some aspect of the referent.",

A suggestion for what makes this possible is that children rely on statistical properties to acquire relevant elements. However, an unresolved question is which aspects of statistical distributions drive or differentiate the acquisition process. We assess potential factors that might influence the acquisition of verb forms in morphologically highly diverse languages. Our data consists of five naturalistic corpora: Chintang, English, Japanese, Turkish, and Yucatec.  \r\nUsing a hierarchical nonlinear scale/location model, we evaluate the following predictors and their influence on the speed of acquisition (productivity computed as entropy):  language; difference between heads and dependents; deviation of empirical input distributions from theoretical Zipf distribution; (log) number of elements; entropy of system.   \r\nUsing model stacking we show that the data is best predicted by the deviation from the Zipfian distribution, closely followed by  number of distinct elements.",

The finding caused a considerable impact and helped motivate the evolutionary Social Brain theory and the influential \u201cgossip\u201d theory of language origins. Using a large corpus of natural Polish conversational data, we revisited Dunbar\u2019s original idea. Mindful of the limitations of Dunbar\u2019s original approach, we re-defined \"social topics''. We randomly selected roughly 10% of all Spokes conversations; two expert judges assessed the transcript lines as concerning a social or non-social topic. We found that roughly equal share of conversation devoted to social (50.9%) and non-social (49.1%) topics. Also, age positively influenced the probability of engaging in a social topic (\u03b2 = 0.015, p < 0.001); for gender, the result was insignificant. We argue the difference might be due to the slight difference in the definition of a \u201csocial topic\u201d.",

        "summary": "Human language has long been thought to be largely arbitrary, meaning that no intrinsic or logical connection exists between form and meaning. Recent studies have shown the increasing relevance of non-arbitrary forms in some languages.  One of these is systematicity, which describes phonological and prosodic cues differentiating between word classes and categories leading to cognitive advantages for language processing and learnability. Previous research has largely ignored a wide sample of languages within a language family. As a result, we examined the role that systematicity plays in 21 modern and ancient Indo-European languages. Specifically, we examined phonological cues towards grammatical categories of the first phoneme to capture the initial word recognition advantages provided by systematicity. Our findings demonstrate the critical and hitherto underestimated role that systematicity plays in the development and stability of certain grammatical macro-categories.",

        "summary": "In this work, I propose that vocal learning complexity is at odds with non-vocal dexterity. In order words, given some conditions generically required for vocal learning behavior, species lacking appendages fine-tuned for grasping, object manipulation, etc. (prehensile appendages) are more likely to display complex vocal behavior than species which do have and expertly use such appendages. I hypothesize that the use of the mouth or analogous structures (and those adjacent to it) for all or most object manipulation and interaction promotes complex vocal behavior. Conversely, the existence of appendages tuned for fine control relegates the vocal apparatus to simpler vocal, feeding, and manipulation behaviors. In conjunction (and indeed in constant interaction) with several other factors, this relationship helps shape the vocal learning phenotype.\n\nThis hypothesis has implications for how vocal learning and related abilities evolved across species, and emphasizes the importance of ecological and behavioral factors for this capacity.",

        "summary": "Although music and spoken language partition the same continuous acoustic dimensions (frequency, formant space and duration) into elements that are combinatorically combined, the resulting categories differ sharply: scale tones and note durations of small integer ratios appear in music, while speech uses phonemes, lexical tone, and non-isochronous durations. We propose a framework based on information theory and a reverse-engineering perspective to explain these differences. We suggest that design features of music and language are a response to their differential deployment along three different continuous dimensions: propositional-aesthetic (\"goal\") and repetitive-novel (\"novelty\"), and a dialogic-choric (\"interactivity\") dimension. Specifically, we hypothesize that music exhibits specializations enhancing coherent production by several individuals concurrently \u2013 the \u201cchoric\u201c context. In contrast, language is specialized for exchange in tightly coordinated turn-taking \u2013 \u201cdialogic\u201c contexts. We propose that the hybrid nature of intermediate systems like poetry, chant, or solo lament follows from their deployment in the less typical interactive context.",

The aim of the experiment is to demonstrate that meaning is the result of communicative interaction, and not just of individual cognitive processes. Linguistic interaction implies a constant process of negotiation through which meaning is redefined and coordinated among agents. It also attempts to shed light on some aspects of the process of meaning negotiation.\nWe present a comprehensive conceptual framework to investigate and quantify the alignment of conversational dictionaries, and how they adjust to contextual demands. Using a well-known experimental framework, we contrast an interaction without sunk-costs with one with sunk-costs to test whether bringing into the game a lexicon acquired during the first stage (without sunk costs) players requires that the conversational agreement adaptively adjust to the increased sunk costs. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to assess and measure the bargaining aspects of communication.",

Learning when and how to vocalize should be adaptively shaped by social context to maintain relationships in the community. The present study addressed this issue by examining socially motivated vocal conditioning on a songbird species, zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). We performed an operant conditioning of vocal behavior by rewarding birds with social feedback, in which the bird can briefly see its cagemate when the bird vocalizes in response to a non-vocal sound stimulus. Additionally, an LED light of different colors was provided as a context cue just before presenting the sound stimulus. A few weeks of conditioning resulted in birds' vocalizing in response to the sound cue. Some of the birds tended to vocalize more for rewarded conditions than unrewarded conditions. The result demonstrates that zebra finches can learn the association between vocalization and social feedback.",

        "summary": "In an evolutionary linguistics context, both constructive (e.g., artificial life, robotics, and experimental semiotics) and cognitive linguistics approaches inquire about the embodied nature of language. However, it is often pointed out that there is still a huge gap between these two areas when it comes to what constitutes language (Di Paolo et al., 2019). To bridge this gap, this paper focuses on how property predication is expressed differently among languages in a cognitive linguistic framework and argues for the importance of noticing the role of pointing that does not establish joint attention. Our study implies that the monologic and non-joint attentional aspects of pointing must be focused on more as a clue to linking action to linguistic constructions with abstract meaning that reflects our structural knowledge of the world.",

        "summary": "It has often been suggested that music and language share a prosodic origin. Music and language have different components linked to specific acoustical properties; Shared functions that are present in both domains as well as in non-human vocal communication are likely to be inherited from phylogenetically older communication systems. This review investigated functions and properties of timbre in instrumental music, prosody and mammalian vocal communication. Timbre conveys emotional information in instrumental music through the same acoustic cues as in prosody and mammalian vocal communication. Identity is communicated in instrumental music through the individual timbral properties of the music, as individual timbral characteristics of the signaler do in prosody and mammalian vocal communication. Thus, I claim that timbre is likely to be a phylogenetically old component of prosody and music, with communication of identity and emotion as a preserved function found today in para-linguistic aspects of prosody and in music.",

        "summary": "Beat is an essential feature of music. We recognize groupings of strong and weak beats, supporting speech perception. While some animals can detect beats (the lower-level grouping), meter perception involving top-down processes has been only reported in humans. To understand language and identify differences between humans' and other animals' abilities regarding language, we attempted to quantify the intensity of beats. In Experiment 1, after presenting several pairs of long and short tones inducing a duple meter, the middle tone was presented twice, with the former middle tone corresponding to a strong or weak beat. In Experiment 2, we made the same conditions but induced a triple meter. We manipulated the sound pressure of the latter middle tone and calculated the proportion that participants judged that the latter tone was stronger. We found that point of subjective equality differed between conditions in each experiment, reflecting the subjective intensity of middle tones.",

        "summary": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social and communication skills. Studies have noted that abnormal brain lateralization predicts difficulties with language learning. This study used EEG recordings from the International Infant EEG Data Integration Platform (EEG-IP); a multi-site cohort study of infants at risk for ASD. It included 92 Infants at risk for autism (must have one full sibling, with an existing ASD diagnosis) and 91 controls. Our results revealed that at 12 months, autistic infants showed atypical patterns of lateralization compared to neurotypical controls (p < 0.05). Infants at risk for autism had more extreme left hemisphere dominance compared to controls. Furthermore, lateralization in the superior temporal gyrus at 6 months was significant correlated to Expressive Language skills at 12 months of age, suggesting that disruption of these networks during infancy can contribute to communication impairments.",

In this paper, we draw on work by Ellison & Miceli (2017) to offer a psycholinguistically-grounded account for language speciation in a way that does not presume a pre-existing fracturing of the linguistic community, or external contact.\n  Speciation begins with lectal variation being associated with an areal, social or situational identity. Three stages of differentiation follow. Form differentiation is an accelerated loss of shared vocabulary in the lects due to bilectalism (in comparison to drift). Structural stability is maintained by the same bilectalism, even when lexical forms have differentiated beyond mutual intelligibility. If bilectalism breaks down, or is restricted, there is then rapid grammatical and semantic structural divergence.\n  This account explains why linguistic diversity in places with egalitarian multilingualism is apparent in lexical forms rather than structural features.",

        "summary": "A great debate exists when it comes to ostensive communication and non-human primates. We sought to further investigate apes\u2019 ostensive capabilities using an object-choice task. Six bonobos with varying levels of language enculturation history were presented with 5 different pointing conditions (Contralateral, Drop Gaze, Object-Ape, Gesture-Object, and Gesture-Ape). These conditions allowed us to separate the point mechanism (the gesture) and the ostensive communication (eye contact and gaze direction), to explore where the bonobos understand the communicative intent and ostensive cues. Results supported the hypothesis that language enculturated apes have some cognitive capacity for understanding ostensive communication. Additionally, in contrast to pilot data, apes performed well on the drop-gaze condition. This discrepancy may be due to altered methodologies, underscoring the need for care when designing studies of this nature.",

We investigated the information-seeking behavior, considered to be metacognitive, of mice while performing visual discriminations. First, we trained mice to discriminate between stimulus pairs with different luminance or angle. The smaller the luminance or angle difference, the more difficult it was to discriminate. During these discriminations, mice were presented with an information-seeking option. When mice sought information, only the target remained on the screen, resulting in that mice always made correct responses. As result, mice sought information more frequently when the task was more difficult, which could be interpreted as the mice seeking information when they were uncertain. However, a detailed analysis revealed that this was not the case. This result will be discussed together with results from other animal species that are thought to have metacognition.",

One possibility is that participants have pre-existing concepts to which verbal labels are mapped. Alignment is then a matter of ensuring that in members of the same speech community, the same word points to the same concept. But how do the underlying conceptual representations become aligned in the first place? One source of alignment is shared sensory experiences mediated by similar perceptual systems. But is this enough? We test the possibility that a powerful source of additional alignment is language itself.",

        "summary": "Communication requires people to align, at least in part, on what words mean. To accomplish this, language learners can observe what a word refers to. However, many words have referents that are abstract or otherwise hard to observe. In addition, many concrete words also have more abstract denotations. In the absence of direct referents, language learners can align word meanings to those of their language community by observing how words are used in context. This mechanism is underappreciated as a driver of semantic alignment across large language communities in which individual speakers are unlikely to ever interact directly. In three experiments, we demonstrate alignment between blind and sighted speakers for the semantic associations of color terms -- whose direct referents can only be observed by the sighted participants -- and demonstrate how a word embedding model can achieve this alignment by learning from word co-occurrence patterns.",

In the present study, we aimed to clarify how discrimination of rhythms composed of different timbres changes, and investigated the accuracy of rhythm discrimination in several experiments. Point of subjective equality (PSE) and discrimination accuracy were estimated by sigmoid approximation to the obtained data. The results showed that even when the reference rhythm pattern was varied, the accuracy of rhythm discrimination decreased when center frequency is different in band noise. The result suggests that frequency differences reduce the accuracy of rhythmic discrimination regardless of the rhythmic pattern. The findings are important in bridging the gap between research on rhythm perception and those on stream segregation.",

        "summary": "Animals' gaze can convey the object of interest and share attention. However, because of the eye structure in birds, instead of eye movement, head movements play a more significant role in gaze shifts in birds. Additionally, most birds with laterally placed eyes usually turn their head to the target by their lateral face. Therefore, we used Bengalese finches to examine whether songbirds can discriminate between conspecific frontal and lateral faces and categorize various face angles. In the experiment, subjects were trained to discriminate conspecific frontal and lateral pictures using Go/Nogo task. Eight out of nine subjects finished discrimination training and test sessions. We found that Bengalese finches can discriminate conspecific gaze direction by discriminating the frontal and lateral face angles. Furthermore, subjects needed fewer trials to achieve the criteria as the stimuli set increased. However, it seems unlikely that a discriminate boundary exists to categorize face angles.",

        "summary": "Why do humans use symbols more than any other animal? We argue that a partial explanation might lie in the effect certain properties of the human sensory world have on language. Research in semiotics usually distinguishes three kinds of signs - indices, icons, and symbols - which are often treated as discrete, separate classes. However, an account of sign types using conceptual blending theory allows us to establish a continuity between them and thus support gradual emergence of symbols. Additionally, analysis of signs from a cross-species perspective should always be done relative to an animal\u2019s Umwelt, i.e. the way the world presents itself to it. Because of this, we suggest that iconic and indexical signs might be much more widespread in the animal world, and that the high reliance on symbols in humans might have emerged due to the dimensionality of the modalities used for communication in the human Umwelt.",

        "summary": "People handle their emotions in multiple strategies including attentional deployment. But such control approaches don't work effectively with people in ruminant tendency. Since negative language output suppresses stress, whereas linguistic self-awareness predicts rumination, language is closely involved in the emotional control. To examine the differences in attention allocation processing in relation to ruminant tendencies, we used EEG data to measure attention with an oddball paradigm under the situation requiring emotional regulation. The analysis shows that attention is directed differently depending on whether the individual tends to ruminate or not, suggesting ruminative tendency negatively impacts attentional deployment. Based on the results, the relation between language evolution and ruminant tendency is discussed.",

        "summary": "Converging evidence shows that humans have a bias towards Agent participant in events. We focus on this bias in language processing and contrast two hypothesis on its evolution, using machine learning experiments. The biologically-driven hypothesis ascribes the bias to an innate property, while  the experience-driven hypothesis ascribes the bias to our experience with the distributional properties in language use.  \nTo probe these two hypotheses, we focus on the specific effect that Agent Bias has on the processing of role-ambiguous noun phrases. We use stimuli from previously conducted EEG experiments of languages that are maximally distinct in how they code Agents: Hindi, Basque and German. These stimuli are fed to neural language models whose knowledge of language is derived from distributional patterns in the linguistic input. \nWe conclude that there is at best marginal evidence for the experience-driven hypothesis with computational models replicating the N400 effect only with one of the languages.",

        "summary": "Prosocial behavior is any behavior performed by one individual to alleviate another's need or improve their welfare, and is thought to be associated with shared intentionality in humans. Recent studies have shown experimental evidence for prosocial behavior in various non-human animal species. The present study examined the factors affecting the feasibility of prosocial behavior in laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus). We found social relationship is not related to feasibility of helping-like behavior (door-opening). Young females were the most likely to demonstrate door-opening. Helpers acquired door-opening when the soaked cage-mates actively rattled the door and the helper rats stayed close to the pool area for a long time. Few ultrasonic vocalizations were observed. Taken together, these results support the idea that helpers\u2019 interest in the trapped cage-mate or the experimental apparatus play an important role in acquisition of helping-like behavior. Thus, psychological motivation for prosocial behavior in rats needs further careful investigation.",

        "summary": "Human language requires not only a sequential operation but also a recursive operation generating hierarchical expressions by combining two elements. How and why did recursive combination (hereafter RC) building hierarchical structures evolve? We pursue the hypothesis of the evolutionary scenario that RC in motor control extended to RC in language in the course of human evolution. In our evolutionary simulation study, we model learning organisms as reinforcement learning agents that explore and learn the process of tool making. The result shows that RC more likely appears as the length of the combination of product increased and in such an environment where a non-random exploratory strategy is adaptive to produce a novel product. This simulation study enables us to elaborate on the hypothesis on the evolution of RC: If an agent can evolutionarily acquire RC as a trait, it would facilitate reinforcement learning exploration, also in the context of language learning.",

        "summary": "It has been suggested that languages change in complexity to accommodate the cognitive constraints of their speaker communities. Surprisingly, multiple recent studies do not find support for this hypothesis. This could be due to misaligned complexity metrics, in which case metrics more informed by psycholinguistic research should yield different results. We take a first step towards investigating this by analyzing if languages with more speakers have a more constrained information density (ID) variability to assist processing. We find that languages exhibit higher ID variability with more speakers. However, we also find that the average ID decreases with the larger numbers of speakers, lowering the average unexpectedness of a syntactic unit. The results suggest that while individual facets of language complexity correlate with sociocultural properties, they can trade off with each other, potentially providing a solution to why some previously studied facets of complexity do not correlate with psycholinguistic difficulty.",

        "summary": "Facial expressions are powerful signals of social communication that have mostly been studied as displays of affect, and less so as pragmatic tools for communication or symbol grounding, in part due to their sheer number/complexity. In two experiments, we applied a data-driven psychophysical method that can navigate this complexity and examined the semiotic potential of facial expressions that occur alongside speech as part of multimodal signaling. Participants viewed multimodal stimuli of talking faces displaying random expressions. For this, we combined generative models of human face movements and identity with transformed voice recordings and synced lip animations. Experiment 1 tested whether facial expressions can communicate quantity (expressing large or tiny numbers). Experiment 2 addressed whether facial expressions can serve as pragmatic markers of confidence/doubt.  Building the statistical relationship between dynamic facial movements and participants\u2019 responses revealed which specific combinations of face movements drove these iconic and pragmatic perceptions in individual participants.",

        "summary": "Theoretical proposals, computational models, cross-linguistic correlational and experimental studies suggest that the sociocultural niche a language occupies (exoteric or esoteric) affects its morphosyntactic complexity. It is encouraging that researchers arrive at similar conclusions using approaches differing in methodological details, which could be taken as hinting at the robustness of the hypothesized effect. At the same time many outstanding questions remain, including (i) are languages in exoteric niches simpler on all dimensions of complexity? and (ii) how are different dimensions of complexity related? Here I explore these question by investigating (i) whether i-complexity differs between exoteric and esoteric languages or is constrained, similarly to some other information-theoretic metrics and (ii) if there exists a trade-off between i-complexity and e-complexity. Taken together, the results suggest that i-complexity is not significantly affected by sociocultural niche, however we see evidence of optimization of this aspect of linguistic structure, potentially supporting its hypothesized psycholinguistic importance.",

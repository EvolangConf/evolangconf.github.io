        "abstract": "In this talk I\u2019ll be asking what, if anything, the past decade of progress in ancient genomics has been able to tell us about the evolution of human language and cognition. While it has clearly been telling us that a sudden emergence/cognitive revolution scenario (Berwick and Chomsky 2016) is (at best) highly unlikely, it seems to me to also call for a more nuanced scenario than the currently favored alternative (\u201crecognizably modern language is likely an ancient feature of our genus pre-dating at least the common ancestor of modern humans and Neandertals about half a million years ago\u201d, as argued in Dediu and Levinson 2013).\nThe case I will make for this more nuanced narrative builds on an examination of regions of modern human genes associated with signals of positive selection and/or depleted from signatures of introgression from other hominins. Collectively, data from these regions point to neural changes that impacted the way we came to share information and learn from others. If correct, this suggests that the languages/grammars that came to be must have had a distinct profile from previous communicative systems.",

        "abstract": "Comparative Approach\n\nJust like our physical body is a product of evolution, so does our behavior. Then it follows that our speech is also a product of evolution. Speech utilizes the respiration system, vocal apparatus, and the brain, all of which are directly, descended from our ancestors. Here I introduce two lines of research, one is on birdsong and the other on rat tweets. These studies should provide with pre-adaptations to speech in animal models (Okanoya, 2007).\n\nDomestication and cultural evolution of complex songs in finches\n\nJuvenile birds learn their courtship songs from their conspecifics through the motor-auditory feedback. Bengalese finches (BFs) are a domesticated strain of wild white-rumped munias (WRMs) imported from China to Japan 270 years ago. BF songs are composed of multiple chunks and each chunk is a combination of 2-4 song notes. Furthermore, chunks are arranged in a finite-state probabilistic automaton. We studied how and why BFs sing such complex songs. We found the following facts. 1) The ancestral strain sings simpler songs. 2) There is high learning specificity in WRMs but not in BFs. 3) BFs have larger song control nuclei and higher level of glutamate receptor gene expressions than WRMs (. 4) Both BF and WRM females prefer complex songs as measured by the nest string assay and males with complex songs are physically fitted than the males with simpler songs. These results promoted sexual selection scenario of song complexity in BFs (Okanoya, 2004).\nWe further examined factors related with domestication. We examined songs of WRMs in subpopulations of Taiwan. Where there is a sympatric species toWRMs, songs were simpler. This leads to a hypothesis that in the wild songs needed to be simple to secure species identification, but under domestication this constrains was set free. We also examined socio-emotional indexes including neophobic tendency, tameness, behavioral stress reactions, and corticosterone levels. All indexes suggested that WRMs have higher level of stress and social shyness, which should be adaptive under natural environment, but could be limiting opportunities for learning complex songs (Okanoya, 2017).\nTo strengthen our hypothesis, we conducted a cultural evolution study. In zebra finches, isolated songs converge into wild type songs after a few generations (Fehr et al, 2009). We isolated juveniles of both strains and reared only by mothers. We used these birds that did not listen to the species-specific songs as founders. After 5 generations, BF songs diverged even more than the founders and never converged. After 3 generations, WRM songs converged into simple patterns, but these were not similar to the wild songs. Results are consistent with the hypothesis on innate constraints of learning in these two strains.\nThus, evolution of song complexity involves not only factors related with strengthen of sexual selection and relaxation of species identification, but also socio- emotional factors due to domestication. Furthermore, recent suggestion of \u2018neural crest\u2019 hypothesis that might account for the domestication syndrome fits well with the properties of Bengalese finches. These results on Bengalese finches must be useful in discussing possible biological origin of human speech in terms of proximate and ultimate factors.\n\nAuditory, cognitive, and brain processing of emotional calls in rats\n\nRats emit distinct emotional calls under specific situations. When they are in a positive state, such as while copulating or being tickled, they emit 50 kHz pleasure calls. When they are in a distress state, such as when being bitten or received an electric shock, they emit 22 kHz calls. Playing back 50 kHz calls attract rats while playing back 20 kHz calls freeze them.\nWe studied how these calls were perceived, changed cognitive states, and processed in the brain. We first examined which acoustical parameters were salient in making discrimination of the two categories of the calls. Rats were trained by an operant go-left, go-right discrimination task. They were then tested with various synthetic calls to find out the salient parameters. We found that the frequency (pitch) is the most salient, followed by duration, and then modulation (Saito et al, 2019).\nNext, we trained rats to discriminate between two pure tones by the same operant procedure. When they learned the discrimination, they were tested withpure tones of the ambiguous frequencies. Rats responded to the negative lever after exposed to the 22 kHz call while they responded to the positive lever after exposed to the 50 kHz call. Thus, their cognitive states were also influenced by these emotion calls (Saito et al, 2017).\nFinally, we tested how these calls were analyzed in the brain. We recorded ERPs from the rat anterior cingulate cortex. ERP amplitudes were stronger to naturally modulated calls than artificial pure tones, and the 50 kHz call emitted stronger response than the 22 kHz call. Taken together, rat emotional calls trigger cognitive bias in the hearer and processed categorically in the brain.\n\nPutting these together\n\nThe birdsong study examined how sequential expertise evolved under sexual selection and domestication. The rat tweet study examined how emotions are conveyed in tweets and affect receivers. These two lines of studies point to important aspects of human speech, namely sequential nature and prosodic modulation.",

        "abstract": "The project of sign language research since its start in the middle of the last century has been to document and describe sign languages of different populations around the world. More recently, this body of research has expanded to include sign languages in small community populations: a village, a town, or a family. Even smaller is the sign language of a single deaf signer, called \u201chome sign\u201d where family and sometimes community members participate in sign communication with this individual. Home signers have been reported in nearly every habitable continent in the world. This project has identified as many as 215 different sign languages, large and small, descriptions of which can be found on glottolog.org. The work on smaller sign languages has been especially fruitful in observing emergence of linguistic structures across as brief as one to three generations of signers. Using our work on a small sign language, Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language, my colleagues and I have joined others in describing how linguistic structure unfolds over time (Meir et al., 2017). Faced with this diversity of languages, our field has debated issues of nomenclature for sign languages and how to describe social and cultural factors that play a role in shaping linguistic features of urban and rural or national and village sign languages. Most of these investigations of community properties focus on sign languages where the presence of deaf people \u2013 a single signer, a family, a village, or a new school for deaf children \u2013 is the impetus leading to the appearance of a sign language. The world language databases, ethnologue.com and glottolog.org, have categorized primary sign languages as those shared in a community of deaf people, distinct from \u201cauxiliary\u201d or \u201calternative\u201d sign languages, such as those used by Australian Indigenous communities (Ellis et al., 2019) which exist alongside and on occasion, in place of the spoken language. Their existence (and persistence) despite no significant presence of deaf people in the community calls for an explanation. Lauren Reed (2021) has described the case of a home signer in Papua Guinea who enjoys a network of willing hearing communicative partners in and beyond his family. They find that hearing signers are not simply bystanders but are contributing to a shared lexicon used by deaf home signers in different villages who have little contact with one another. Because some have more mobility, hearing signers are transporting signs across geographic space. These sign languages, which they call \u201cnetwork sign languages\u201d (because there is no deaf community as such), exist at the outer bounds of the more deeply researched deaf community sign languages. But they may yet yield unexpected insights into the vast human capacity to build nascent languages when faced with communicative need. If sign languages have helped us to understand properties of spoken languages, small and nascent sign languages \u2013 of all types \u2013 may be opportunities for us to track the interweaving of social pattern with language use and transmission, as it unfolds in human time.",

Recently, Levinson (2006) and Levinson and Holler (2014) proposed that it is not language that makes human communication possible, but a special capacity for social interaction. This capacity is a layered assemblage of different social cognitive skills including joint attention, common ground, collaboration and reasoning about communicative intent (Clark 1996). It involves the specific characteristics of face-to-face interaction, frequent employment of mutual gaze, and the exchange of rapid communicative turns.\nSurprisingly, this hypothesis has received relatively little research attention in the fields of Animal Behavior and Comparative Psychology (but see Logue and Stivers 2012; Rossano 2013; Genty et al. 2020; Heesen et al. 2022; Pika et al. 2018). The present paper will draw attention to this promising research avenue by (i) providing an overview of the state of the art, and (ii) introducing useful candidates of human social interaction which may be shared across species and taxa.",

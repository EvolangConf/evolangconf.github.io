        "abstract": "What are the social, environmental, and cognitive pressures that shape the evolution of language in our species? Why are there so many different languages in the world? And how did this astonishing linguistic diversity come about? These are some of the most interesting questions in the fields of cognitive science and linguistics, and represent the range of topics discussed in my research so far.\nMy work focuses on linking core aspects of language acquisition, language evolution, and language diversity using a range of novel behavioral paradigms and computational models. My goals are to (1) shed light on the communicative pressures and cognitive constraints (e.g., memory limitations, input variability, generalization, multimodality) that shape language use and social interaction in our species, and (2) to identify the social, environmental, and cross-cultural factors (e.g., population size, network structure, gender/age distribution, noisy physical conditions) that lead to language diversity and to cross-linguistic variation.\nIn this talk, I will provide an overview of my research (including methods and results from selected projects), as well as present future directions and ongoing work. Specifically, I will outline previous studies that used group communication experiments and artificial language learning experiments to test the live formation and acquisition of new languages in the lab. I will focus on the effect of population size, namely, the differences between languages that evolved in big vs. small mini-communities in terms of their compositional structure, their rate of change, and their ease of learning. I will then discuss the role of input variability in underlying group size effects and shaping this evolutionary process, as well as shaping humans\u2019 learning and generalization more broadly. Finally, I will link these results to the human self-domestication hypothesis for language evolution, highlighting recent work that tests key components of self- domestication (e.g., prosociality, interaction with strangers) in new animal models and in AIs.",

        "abstract": "Human language sharply differs from animal communication systems in that it is adaptive not only for communication but also for creative, complex thinking (internal mental calculations such as inference, planning, imagination, etc.), but it is a totally different issue, still remaining open, whether language initially evolved as a tool of communication or as a tool of thought. While many researchers, linguists and biologists alike, opt for the communication view, the opposite view, that language was originally an internal tool of private thought and only later reused for communicative purposes when coupled with some means of externalizing such thoughts (gestures, signs, vocalizations, etc.), is also favored by linguists of a certain theoretical persuasion (Berwick & Chomsky, 2016). Both views have their own merits and demerits, and it is worth considering the possibility of unifying them into an integrative co-evolutionary theory of thought and thought. I will argue that \u201cmultiple attention,\u201d here defined as a cognitive capacity for paying and maintaining attention to more than one object, provides a key to such an integration.\nIt is important to note that language is a complex trait consisting of several subfunctions each of which may have evolved in other species independently before they were linked together to form the human language faculty. In other words, there is no single precursor to human language, hence no single original function. Different views stem from which of these subfunctions one focuses on. While gestures and vocalization, as well as cooperativeness, prosociality and mind reading, are obviously linked to communicative functions, the kind of hierarchical syntax that is sometimes taken to be the hallmark of human language(structure dependence) may not be so. Rather, its contribution to complex, hierarchical thought seems more likely, given in particular that structure dependence often gives rise to structural ambiguity such that the same linear strings of words have more than one semantic interpretation depending on which hierarchical structure they derive from, which hinders efficient communication. Thus there is an apparent tension or dilemma between complex thought and communication.\nA close examination of linguistic hierarchical structure, in particular of how complex structures are dynamically built up from scratch, reveals that there is a common cognitive underpinning for structure dependence and socialcommunicative behavior; namely, one needs to pay attention to multiple objects as a target of internal mental manipulation, freely switching between them. This is illustrated by comparing a basic linguistic structure like [[ the dog ][ saw [ the cat ]]] (where the dog and the cat are derived separately, to be later integrated into a single structure) and intention sharing (or shared intentionality; Tomasello, 2008) between a speaker and a hearer (each takes note of the other\u2019s intent and tries to conform). I suggest that this kind of multiple attention allowed the co-evolution of complex thought (by hierarchical linguistic structure) and communication (by mind-reading for intention sharing).\nPreviously, the thought-first view was advanced on certain debatable assumptions about language evolution, in particular that there was no protolanguage, and that human language came into being abruptly when the capacity for hierarchical structure building (sometimes known as \u201cMerge\u201d) emerged by some mutation, without any precursor. There are other more natural assumptions we should take into serious account which reconcile the thought view with the communication view. It can be argued, for instance, that there was a protolanguage stage where it already served for the purpose of both thought and communication, and that the shift from linear protolanguage (Jackendoff & Wittenberg, 2016) to hierarchical human language changed human thought more drastically than human communication. More pertinent to the present discussion, however, is the idea that hierarchical syntax is supported by the same cognitive trait that underlies human communication.\nIn such a co-evolutionary scenario, the role of externalization cannot be overemphasized. Rather than being a subsidiary process added later, it was the core feature that made it possible to manipulate abstract linguistic concepts on a par with concrete objects to create more and more complex thoughts. Language is more than communication, but it could not have evolved without communication via externalization.",

        "abstract": "As our closest living relatives, non-human primates (henceforth primates) provide a unique lens through which we can explore the evolutionary basis for our behavioural and cognitive capacities, including for language. Over the past four decades, there has been intense amount of interest in the communicative capacities of primates and in particular, what they tell us about the evolutionary origins of language. Inspired by seminal work of Seyfarth, Cheney and colleagues (e.g. Seyfarth et al., 1980), the initial focus of interest was mostly on primate vocalisations, particularly monkey alarm calls, and what they could inform about the evolution of semantics, syntax and relatedly social cognition (e.g. Zuberbuhler, 2005). A large body of research has, in particular, been dedicated to the study of functional reference, considered an evolutionary precursor to linguistic reference (Clay et al, 2010; Townsend & Manser, 2013). Referential signals must fulfill both the production criteria of being tightly associated with their eliciting stimulus as well as the perception criteria of eliciting the same response in a receiver as the putative referent would do (in its absence) (Macedonia & Evans, 2003). While evidence of functionally referential signals has provided important insights into the evolutionary building blocks of semantics and other linguistic properties, empirical focus on such signals, which by definition are functionally fixed, may have led to a biased view of primate communication which fails to take into account its apparent flexibility (Taylor et al., 2022) and multimodal nature (Liebal et al., 2014). In addition, by focusing so heavily on referential primate calls, the comparative literature has dedicated relatively scant attention towards the affective nature of primate signals, which have long been deemed out of the realms of scientific investigation and even scientifically uninteresting.\nNevertheless, comparative research is now starting to address these imbalances, and as a consequence, offers new and exciting insights into primate communication that enable a richer picture of the complex mosaic of traits which underlie language evolution. In this presentation, I will discuss three key empirical shifts that are starting to occur in the primate communication literature and their relevance for understanding language evolution.\nThe first is a growing appreciation of the functionally flexible nature of primate vocalisations. While certain linguistic signals are tightly associated with their referents, many are actually highly context-dependent and loosely associated with their referents, enabling them to fulfill a range of functions. We have argued that the same may also be true for primate signals and that very notion of functional reference needs revision in order to account for the important role of context (Scarantino & Clay, 2015) as well as the functionally flexible nature of most primate vocalisations (Taylor et al., 2022).\nThe second is a greater focus on the multi-modal nature of primate communication and its relevance to language. Until recently, most primate communication research has focused on unimodal signals with often a strong discontinuity in both theoretical and methodological approaches between modalities, particularly vocalisations and gestures (Liebal et al., 2014). Focusing on one modality alone can result in biased views about the evolutionary basis of language. For instance, many theories have focused on a unimodal origin of language, despite the fact that both primate communication and human language are multi-modal. Thus, although such work on multi-modality is still in its infancy, addressing this imbalance in primate research is starting to enable more accurate and balanced models of language origins (Slocombe et al., 2011; Liebal et al., 2014, 2022).\nThe third shift is a steadily growing interest in the affective basis of primate communication and its relation to intentionality (Heesen et al., 2022). Although intentional communication about affective states is a central part of human communication, there has long been a perceived discontinuity between intentional versus affective signaling in primate communication. In particular, primate vocalisations and facial expressions have been traditionally viewed as involuntary expressions of internal states, whereas gestures are by definition intentional. Nevertheless, such a view is increasingly contentious given evidence of intentional vocal and facial expression production, as well as the apparent void of arousal-based explanations in gesture research. By showing that primate signals can be both affective and intentional, regardless of signal modality, a more dimensional approach can contribute to a richer picture of primate communicationand how its affective and cognitive processes have jointly shaped the evolution of language.",

We believe that integrating these two characteristics makes humans co-creative and intelligent. In this talk, I introduce two studies taking an emergent complex approach. It is a methodology to analyze complex systems by constructing and operating the evolutionary and emergent process of complex phenomena and plays a vital role in the attempt of Evolinguistics. One research I introduce is an evolutionary simulation of recursive combination, which is thought of as the essential ability to form hierarchical structures in language and many human cultural products. The other is an experimental semiotic study to consider the process, mechanisms, and neural basis of symbolic communication systems. Finally, I propose a hypothesis that understanding others\u2019 intentions is realized by abduction, which consists of hypothesis generation and their selection, and that the former is brought by recursive combination and the latter by embodiment. This hypothesis is a sort of integration of hierarchy and intention sharing.",

        "abstract": "Any meaningful hypothesis to account for the emergence of language faculty needs to be congruent with our knowledge about the history of human evolution, which is continuously updated based on paleoanthropological researches. It also should consider the ecology of human ancestors, given that natural selection has shaped functional traits as adaptation to their physical as well as social environment. During the last five years, I have participated in the Evolinguistics Project as a member of the Human Evolution Team. The key role that our team has played in the project has been to bring historical and ecological perspectives to the study of language evolution. I will talk about some of the issues that we have worked on in this research program. As a basic premise, I consider the evolution of language faculty as a long-term, step-by-step process through the seven-million-year history of human evolution, rather than a single major event. I also assume that sub-functions composing the language faculty emerged sequentially during the process, some of which may have emerged, perhaps long before language itself, as preadaptations.\nFor the purpose of summarizing the relevant historical framework as simply as possible, without being overwhelmed by the vast detailed information, I propose a highly simplified three-phase scheme for the history of human evolution (Ihara, forthcoming). Phase 1 of the scheme corresponds to the first several million years since the human-chimpanzee divergence. Among the African apes at that time, the early hominins were unique in that they were bipedal and had reduced canine teeth. The transition to Phase 2 is marked by the beginning of the oldest stone-tool industry. During Phase 2 there was a dramatic increase of brain size, which chronologically parallels increasing sophistication of tool-making technologies. This is also when early Homo diffused out ofAfrica for the first time in the human history. A second phase transition is equated with the advent of novel types of artifacts, such as personal ornaments and arts, so-called modern human behavior. For example, one of the oldest signs of modern human behavior is the 75,000-year-old shell beads from South Africa.\nI further argue that each of these phases may be characterized by a distinct dominant evolutionary force, and that they were not just temporally consecutive, but also causally connected (Ihara, forthcoming). To be specific, I speculate that social and life-history evolution that occurred in Phase 1 set the stage for cognitive evolution in Phase 2, which enable cultural evolution in Phase 3. I am aware that this is all too simplistic, and I do not intend to suggest, for example, that social and life-history evolution took place only in Phase 1. Nevertheless, this kind of schematization may hopefully help to draw attention to the possible role of niche construction in human evolution and a sort of evolutionary cascade that may have resulted to drive phenotypic diversification between modern humans and non-human apes.\nI will discuss some specific research topics that have been studied in the Human Evolution Team, including hominin confrontational scavenging (Nakamura et al., 2019), manufacture of composite tools (Sano et al., 2019), social selection to favor reduced aggression (Ihara, 2020), and hierarchical object manipulation (Hayashi & Takeshita, 2022).",

        "abstract": "Great apes are skillful communicators, and enculturation studies have shown that they have an impressive latent potential to acquire human-like communication systems. Nevertheless, only humans have evolved language, and this requires an explanation. Here we argue that a broader phylogenetic perspective that not only focuses on great apes can provide complementary insights by identifying cases of convergent evolution.\nWe focus on callitrichid monkeys, who like humans are cooperative breeders, i.e. individuals others than the mothers are significantly involved in raising the group\u2019s offspring. Group members thus frequently have to closely coordinate their activities and actions, such as handing over infants from one carrier to another, or deciding who engages in infant care or group defense. Callitrichid monkeys are equipped with a set of socio-cognitive skills and abilities that facilitate this coordination and that show striking similarities to elements of the so-called human interaction engine (Levinson & Holler 2014): reliance on mutual gaze as coordination smoother, turn-taking, intentional prosociality, and tuning in with others at the physiological and behavioral level. Thus, the \u201ccallitrichid interaction engine\u201d may have catalyzed the emergence of flexible communication in callitrichid monkeys (Burkart et al. 2022), like in humans.\nA short review of vocal communication in callitrichids indeed reveals high plasticity which appears rare in non-human primates. They are highly voluble, have large repertoires, and frequently produce combinations of two or more calls. Some calls are functionally referential and callitrichids use the information aboutidentity, group and sex encoded in the calls. They also have some voluntary control over their vocalizations, engage in vocal turn-taking (ontogenetically learned, supported by adult scaffolding), and show some vocal learning even as adults (accommodation). Infants engage in extended bouts of babbling, which predicts the quality of vocal production at the end of infancy but also elicits social interactions from adults, reflecting the special challenges that growing up in such a cooperative breeding system imposes on immatures (Hrdy & Burkart 2020).\nIt has been argued that to understand the origin of human language, it is crucial to understand the origin of the sociality that enabled its evolution, the human interaction engine. The work on callitrichid monkeys suggests that cooperative breeding contributed to the emergence of several of the elements typically attributed to the human interaction engine, most importantly perhaps high levels of prosociality that become evident in the human eagerness to share information. Since even enculturated, language trained apes rarely use their skills in declarative ways to inform others, and thus clearly lack a strong and intrinsic Mitteilungsbed\u00fcrfnis, this may well have been crucial for language to evolve. Other elements of the human interaction engine may well be unique to humans, or shared with primates generally. Based on currently available primate data, a good working hypothesis may be that our uniquely human language system could emerge because of our double legacy. On the one hand, as great apes, we have inherited from our closest relatives many of the cognitive prerequisites; on the other hand, because our ancestors, unlike all other great apes, started to engage in cooperative breeding and additional forms of intensive cooperation that led to strong interdependence, prosocial motivational dispositions were convergently added and together paved the way for language to emerge.",

In this talk I review and update this hypothesis in light of cross-species, neural, and genetic research since that time, including research on nonhuman primates, birds, pinnipeds, humans, and rodents (Patel, 2021). Based on this research I maintain that there are important evolutionary and neural relations between vocal learning and beat-based rhythmic processing. I also hypothesize that gene-culture coevolution elaborated on these links to produce neural specializations for beat processing in the dorsal auditory stream of the human brain. I suggest that beat-based rhythmic processing provides a model system for studying cognitive gene-culture coevolution, in which neuroscientific, cross-species, and genetic research can be meaningfully integrated (Patel, in press).",

Based on experimental evidence from our laboratory observations, I discuss the inferential nature of pointing gestures. To interpret pointing gesture, it is necessary to recognize the accompanying characteristics of pointing gestures and make relevant inferences in the given context. The present results show that both children and adults are sensitive to inferential nature of pointing gesture and appropriately use the information for word learning.
